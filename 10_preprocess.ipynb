       "      <td>The use of standardized testing in schools has been a topic of debate for many years. Write an essay stating your position on whether standardized tests are an accurate measure of student ability, using specific reasons and examples to support your argument.</td>\n",
       "      <td>\"Standardized Test: An Accurate Measure of Student Ability?\"\\n\\nStandardized testing in schools is a controversial subject. Supporters argue that standardized tests provide an accurate and objective measure of student ability. However, others question whether these tests truly measure a student's potential and instead argue that there are better and more effective ways to evaluate students. In this essay, I will discuss why standardized tests are not always accurate measures of student ability.\\n\\nFirstly, standardized tests often do not account for the different learning styles of each student. Some students may excel in multiple-choice format while others might struggle with them due to the fact that they do not have an opportunity to express their thoughts and ideas. For example, a student who may excel at presenting information orally may struggle when asked to write an exam.

These exams are usually designed with a specific demographic in mind, often ignoring the diversity of our classrooms.

       "      <td>\"Standardized Test: An Accurate Measure of Student Ability?\" Standardized testing in schools is a controversial subject. Supporters argue that standardized tests provide an accurate and objective measure of student ability. However, others question whether these tests truly measure a student's potential and instead argue that there are better and more effective ways to evaluate students. In this essay, I will discuss why standardized tests are not always accurate measures of student ability. Firstly, standardized tests often do not account for the different learning styles of each student. Some students may excel in multiple-choice format while others might struggle with them due to the fact that they do not have an opportunity to express their thoughts and ideas. For example, a student who may excel at presenting information orally may struggle when asked to write an exam. This does not mean that they are any less knowledgeable or capable than other students; it simply means that standardized tests do not always allow students to exhibit their best work and knowledge. Secondly, standardized tests often do not account for the cultural differences of each student. These exams are usually designed with a specific demographic in mind, often ignoring the diversity of our classrooms. For example, a standardized exam may use language or phrases that a student whose first language is not English may not be familiar with, thereby putting them at a disadvantage. This is especially true of students from minority backgrounds, who may not have the same educational opportunities as others. Lastly, standardized tests often do not take into account the unique challenges that each student may be facing. There may be students who are dealing with personal struggles like illness or family problems that affect their academic performance. In cases like these, standardized tests may not accurately reflect a student's actual level of knowledge or skill. Therefore, it can be concluded that standardized testing is not always an accurate measure of student ability. While it is a convenient way to measure a broad range of knowledge quickly and efficiently, it does have several limitations and shortcomings that need to be taken into account. Instead, it may be more beneficial to use a variety of different assessment methods, including classroom-based assessments and performance assignments, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a student's abilities and skills. This way, we can be sure that each student is receiving a fair and equal opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, regardless of their cultural background, learning style or personal challenges they may be facing.</td>\n",

If a student stays at home all day they may have to interact with stay-at-home parents and family pets who could be very distracting. Students who feel that they can not tell a pesky parent to stop bothering them will end up juggling their schoolwork, family life, and walking the dog. In traditional schools, students learn in classrooms everyday. When students attend online school they could do their work anywhere. Locations such as bedrooms, living rooms and next to the television are not good environments for learning. Students should find a spot which is only used for their schoolwork. Students at traditional schools will be free from these distractions and poor learning environments which may improve their grades.\\n\\nOnline schools could end up costing families and schools systems more. If families have to make sure their student has a working laptop computer everyday then they will spend more money on care and maintenance. Some families might not be able to spend extra money on a new device. Kids could be stuck with old devices that malfunction and do not have updated software. Old computers may not be able to keep up with all the programs students are expected to use. School systems will also have to hire staff so they can operate online schools. New teachers and technological aides would cause taxes to be increased. Families may not be able to keep up with this change. Online schools may seem like a budget friendly option because of lower transportation costs, but for some families it might be catastrophic.\\n\\nOnline school could benefit some groups of students like those with long term illnesses and some certain types of learning styles. Students that can not come to a traditional school because of illness but still have enough time and energy to continue learning should look into online schools. That way student who may have to miss months at a time can still keep up with their classmates. Another good use of online school would be for students with different learning styles. Some kids can not sit through long block scheduled classes and would thrive if they could split up the work in a different way. These students could have more freedom with the way they wanted to work and might be more interested in learning. Online school could contribute to certain groups of students continuing to grow intellectually and good learning habits, but overall would not work for the majority of students.\\n\\nOnline school currently has many problems, but if those problems can be fixed, online schools would be a great resource depending on what the future holds.

This'll explain what it is,its defenses to the attacks on getting rid of it,and finally why it was created in the first place.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was a process created by the four fathers in the Constitution to established the election of the \"President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\"-\\n\\nSource 1: What Is the Electrol College,paragraph 1.\\n\\nThe Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Majority electorcal votes for President is 270. \"Congressional delegtion: On for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.\"-\\n\\nParagrah 2,What Is the Electoral College.\\n\\nYes this involves in the 23rd Amendment of the Contitution that Washington D.C or District or Columbia is allocated 3 electors and is treated like a state in the Electoral College. The electors for a candidate running for President has a group of electors generally by his/her's political party.\\n\\nMany believe there is something wrong with the Eledtoral College. Even some like \"Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, And the AFL-CIO\"-\\n\\nSource 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong.\\n\\nThey all have in common is that they want to abolish the Electoral College. However the party will get to \"select a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.\"-\\n\\nSource 3 paragraph 2.\\n\\nHowever rarely do you actually see it's possible for the winner to get eletoral vote but not popular vote. in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes then Bush. But the agurement falls apart since it happens rarely. It was the frist time since 1888 that's about 112 years that this has happened. It's even highly unlikely it will end in a tie-as 538 is an even number it is divied to the states.\\n\\nIt was started by the founding fathers in order to have a informed government. It is rumored that they believed that the common person the person who votes for popularity is to uninformed to choose who will be President. So in the Constitution they put it as a \"pompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress by popular vote of qulified citizens.       \n",

Supporters argue that standardized tests provide an accurate and objective measure of student ability. However, others question whether these tests truly measure a student's potential and instead argue that there are better and more effective ways to evaluate students. In this essay, I will discuss why standardized tests are not always accurate measures of student ability.\\n\\nFirstly, standardized tests often do not account for the different learning styles of each student. Some students may excel in multiple-choice format while others might struggle with them due to the fact that they do not have an opportunity to express their thoughts and ideas. For example, a student who may excel at presenting information orally may struggle when asked to write an exam. This does not mean that they are any less knowledgeable or capable than other students; it simply means that standardized tests do not always allow students to exhibit their best work and knowledge.\\n\\nSecondly, standardized tests often do not account for the cultural differences of each student. These exams are usually designed with a specific demographic in mind, often ignoring the diversity of our classrooms. For example, a standardized exam may use language or phrases that a student whose first language is not English may not be familiar with, thereby putting them at a disadvantage. This is especially true of students from minority backgrounds, who may not have the same educational opportunities as others.\\n\\nLastly, standardized tests often do not take into account the unique challenges that each student may be facing. There may be students who are dealing with personal struggles like illness or family problems that affect their academic performance. In cases like these, standardized tests may not accurately reflect a student's actual level of knowledge or skill.\\n\\nTherefore, it can be concluded that standardized testing is not always an accurate measure of student ability. While it is a convenient way to measure a broad range of knowledge quickly and efficiently, it does have several limitations and shortcomings that need to be taken into account. Instead, it may be more beneficial to use a variety of different assessment methods, including classroom-based assessments and performance assignments, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a student's abilities and skills. This way, we can be sure that each student is receiving a fair and equal opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, regardless of their cultural background, learning style or personal challenges they may be facing.   \n",

The author claims this could be very useful in teaching, for being able to acount for the student's emotions could very well help the computer adapt and change the lesson more efficiently. While this could be true, there are a lot of questions that should be asked before this technology can be implemented, such as it's effectiveness and privacy.\\n\\nThe sixth paragraph says how the computer can know if you're happy or sad, and gives an example \"If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad may follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" This seems to be very helpful, but what if said person was smiling about something else? what if the person remembers something funny that happened the other day and suddenly they notice they keep getting uninteresting ads that pop up? There would be no way for the computer to tell if it was really the ad that made the person smile. Another issue is how it is used in class. Paragraph six states \"A classroom computer could recognize if a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" How would the computer tell what degree a pupil is confused? If a student looks a little confused, the computer may read this and respond as if the student was very confused, thus wasting the student's time with more help than they need. One more way to look at it is the privacy violations the software may bring. What if a student is opposed to a teacher being able to technologically and truthfully read the students emotions? does the computer take a log of the faces of the students? There is too many suspicious questions in regard to the morality and safety of the use of such software.\\n\\nThe software definitely shows promise. It seems to show how far we have come to understanding the relation to facial expressions and emotion. That being said, there is still too much to account for before this new technology can be integrated into classrooms, such as efficiency and morality.   \n",
       "32044  Many school systems now offer distance learning, an option for students to learn at home through online methods.\\n\\nStudents are able to video conference with teachers, watch prerecorded lectures, and receive and submit assignments on sites like Google Classroom and Blackboard. The question that should be asked is if students actually benefit from online classes. Some students with long term illnesses and specific learning styles would learn better, but overall most students should choose to avoid online school because of fewer social interactions with peers, more learning distractions at home, and additional costs for students' families and schools.\\n\\nStudents will have less social interaction which may put them behind when it comes to going to college and entering the workforce. If students who chose to attend an online school throughout high school decide to go to a traditional college they may be at a disadvantage. Depending on what they major in, it could be very similar to their experience with online school. Other students would be faced with new challenges like labs and group projects. If a students has never done group work before they may struggle with communication and teamwork aspect that it takes to complete difficult group projects. It is possible that these students may struggle during their first year or two at college purely because they have trouble interacting with their peers. Online students may also struggle when entering the workforce. They may lack certain social skills necessary to shine during interviews. It is wise to send student to traditional school so they can absorb some of the culture that is needed to get far in life.\\n\\nStudents need to be able to get close to their peers through shared experiences at traditional schools in order to really excel in life.\\n\\nStudents learn better in school environments because they are faced with less distractions. Students who switch to online school may see a drop in grades because they are faced with new distractions like family members, pets, and poor learning spaces. If a student stays at home all day they may have to interact with stay-at-home parents and family pets who could be very distracting. Students who feel that they can not tell a pesky parent to stop bothering them will end up juggling their schoolwork, family life, and walking the dog. In traditional schools, students learn in classrooms everyday. When students attend online school they could do their work anywhere. Locations such as bedrooms, living rooms and next to the television are not good environments for learning. Students should find a spot which is only used for their schoolwork. Students at traditional schools will be free from these distractions and poor learning environments which may improve their grades.\\n\\nOnline schools could end up costing families and schools systems more. If families have to make sure their student has a working laptop computer everyday then they will spend more money on care and maintenance. Some families might not be able to spend extra money on a new device. Kids could be stuck with old devices that malfunction and do not have updated software. Old computers may not be able to keep up with all the programs students are expected to use. School systems will also have to hire staff so they can operate online schools. New teachers and technological aides would cause taxes to be increased. Families may not be able to keep up with this change. Online schools may seem like a budget friendly option because of lower transportation costs, but for some families it might be catastrophic.\\n\\nOnline school could benefit some groups of students like those with long term illnesses and some certain types of learning styles. Students that can not come to a traditional school because of illness but still have enough time and energy to continue learning should look into online schools. That way student who may have to miss months at a time can still keep up with their classmates. Another good use of online school would be for students with different learning styles. Some kids can not sit through long block scheduled classes and would thrive if they could split up the work in a different way. These students could have more freedom with the way they wanted to work and might be more interested in learning. Online school could contribute to certain groups of students continuing to grow intellectually and good learning habits, but overall would not work for the majority of students.\\n\\nOnline school currently has many problems, but if those problems can be fixed, online schools would be a great resource depending on what the future holds. Online schools may be more popular in the future, but for the present traditional schools are more effective for the growth of students. In conclusion online schools are better for some students, but right now most students should stay at a traditional school because of more social interactions, fewer distractions, and fewer costs for schools and families.    \n",

Here's my essay on the potential pros and cons of three year high school graduation programs for high school students.\\n\\nSo, the thing is, some people think that high school should only last three years instead of the usual four. And I can see why. I mean, think about it, four years is a long time, right? And some kids might get bored or lose interest in school after a while. But then again, there are some pretty big cons to consider too.\\n\\nOne pro is that three year high school graduation programs would give students more time to focus on their passions and interests. Like, imagine being able to take more advanced classes in a specific subject, or even start a business or club. It would be pretty cool to have more time to explore your interests and make them a bigger part of your high school experience.\\n\\nAnother pro is that it could help students who are struggling in school. If high school only lasted three years, students might have more time to catch up on their work or get extra help from teachers. And it could also help students who are ahead of the game, because they could take more advanced classes and get a head start on college or their future careers.\\n\\nBut there are also some pretty big cons to consider. One of them is that it could be really hard to fit in all the necessary classes and credits in just three years. Like, you'd have to take a lot of classes at once, and it might be hard to balance schoolwork with extracurriculars and other stuff. And if you don't get the right schedule, you might end up missing out on important classes or activities.\\n\\nAnother con is that it could be really tough on students who are not as academically inclined. If high school only lasts three years, they might not have as much time to catch up or get the help they need. And it could also be hard on students who are really into their extracurriculars, because they might not have as much time to participate in sports, clubs, or other activities.\\n\\nSo, overall, I think three year high school graduation programs could be a pretty interesting idea, but there are definitely some pros and cons to consider.

This'll explain what it is,its defenses to the attacks on getting rid of it,and finally why it was created in the first place. The Electoral College was a process created by the four fathers in the Constitution to established the election of the \"President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\"- Source 1: What Is the Electrol College,paragraph 1. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Majority electorcal votes for President is 270. \"Congressional delegtion: On for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.\"- Paragrah 2,What Is the Electoral College. Yes this involves in the 23rd Amendment of the Contitution that Washington D.C or District or Columbia is allocated 3 electors and is treated like a state in the Electoral College. The electors for a candidate running for President has a group of electors generally by his/her's political party. Many believe there is something wrong with the Eledtoral College. Even some like \"Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, And the AFL-CIO\"- Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. They all have in common is that they want to abolish the Electoral College. However the party will get to \"select a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.\"- Source 3 paragraph 2. However rarely do you actually see it's possible for the winner to get eletoral vote but not popular vote. in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes then Bush. But the agurement falls apart since it happens rarely. It was the frist time since 1888 that's about 112 years that this has happened. It's even highly unlikely it will end in a tie-as 538 is an even number it is divied to the states. It was started by the founding fathers in order to have a informed government. It is rumored that they believed that the common person the person who votes for popularity is to uninformed to choose who will be President. So in the Constitution they put it as a \"pompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress by popular vote of qulified citizens.   \n",

Supporters argue that standardized tests provide an accurate and objective measure of student ability. However, others question whether these tests truly measure a student's potential and instead argue that there are better and more effective ways to evaluate students. In this essay, I will discuss why standardized tests are not always accurate measures of student ability. Firstly, standardized tests often do not account for the different learning styles of each student. Some students may excel in multiple-choice format while others might struggle with them due to the fact that they do not have an opportunity to express their thoughts and ideas. For example, a student who may excel at presenting information orally may struggle when asked to write an exam. This does not mean that they are any less knowledgeable or capable than other students; it simply means that standardized tests do not always allow students to exhibit their best work and knowledge. Secondly, standardized tests often do not account for the cultural differences of each student. These exams are usually designed with a specific demographic in mind, often ignoring the diversity of our classrooms. For example, a standardized exam may use language or phrases that a student whose first language is not English may not be familiar with, thereby putting them at a disadvantage. This is especially true of students from minority backgrounds, who may not have the same educational opportunities as others. Lastly, standardized tests often do not take into account the unique challenges that each student may be facing. There may be students who are dealing with personal struggles like illness or family problems that affect their academic performance. In cases like these, standardized tests may not accurately reflect a student's actual level of knowledge or skill. Therefore, it can be concluded that standardized testing is not always an accurate measure of student ability. While it is a convenient way to measure a broad range of knowledge quickly and efficiently, it does have several limitations and shortcomings that need to be taken into account. Instead, it may be more beneficial to use a variety of different assessment methods, including classroom-based assessments and performance assignments, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a student's abilities and skills. This way, we can be sure that each student is receiving a fair and equal opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, regardless of their cultural background, learning style or personal challenges they may be facing.   \n",

The author claims this could be very useful in teaching, for being able to acount for the student's emotions could very well help the computer adapt and change the lesson more efficiently. While this could be true, there are a lot of questions that should be asked before this technology can be implemented, such as it's effectiveness and privacy. The sixth paragraph says how the computer can know if you're happy or sad, and gives an example \"If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad may follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" This seems to be very helpful, but what if said person was smiling about something else? what if the person remembers something funny that happened the other day and suddenly they notice they keep getting uninteresting ads that pop up? There would be no way for the computer to tell if it was really the ad that made the person smile. Another issue is how it is used in class. Paragraph six states \"A classroom computer could recognize if a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" How would the computer tell what degree a pupil is confused? If a student looks a little confused, the computer may read this and respond as if the student was very confused, thus wasting the student's time with more help than they need. One more way to look at it is the privacy violations the software may bring. What if a student is opposed to a teacher being able to technologically and truthfully read the students emotions? does the computer take a log of the faces of the students? There is too many suspicious questions in regard to the morality and safety of the use of such software. The software definitely shows promise. It seems to show how far we have come to understanding the relation to facial expressions and emotion. That being said, there is still too much to account for before this new technology can be integrated into classrooms, such as efficiency and morality.   \n",
       "32044  Many school systems now offer distance learning, an option for students to learn at home through online methods. Students are able to video conference with teachers, watch prerecorded lectures, and receive and submit assignments on sites like Google Classroom and Blackboard. The question that should be asked is if students actually benefit from online classes. Some students with long term illnesses and specific learning styles would learn better, but overall most students should choose to avoid online school because of fewer social interactions with peers, more learning distractions at home, and additional costs for students' families and schools. Students will have less social interaction which may put them behind when it comes to going to college and entering the workforce. If students who chose to attend an online school throughout high school decide to go to a traditional college they may be at a disadvantage. Depending on what they major in, it could be very similar to their experience with online school. Other students would be faced with new challenges like labs and group projects. If a students has never done group work before they may struggle with communication and teamwork aspect that it takes to complete difficult group projects. It is possible that these students may struggle during their first year or two at college purely because they have trouble interacting with their peers. Online students may also struggle when entering the workforce. They may lack certain social skills necessary to shine during interviews. It is wise to send student to traditional school so they can absorb some of the culture that is needed to get far in life. Students need to be able to get close to their peers through shared experiences at traditional schools in order to really excel in life. Students learn better in school environments because they are faced with less distractions. Students who switch to online school may see a drop in grades because they are faced with new distractions like family members, pets, and poor learning spaces. If a student stays at home all day they may have to interact with stay-at-home parents and family pets who could be very distracting. Students who feel that they can not tell a pesky parent to stop bothering them will end up juggling their schoolwork, family life, and walking the dog. In traditional schools, students learn in classrooms everyday. When students attend online school they could do their work anywhere. Locations such as bedrooms, living rooms and next to the television are not good environments for learning. Students should find a spot which is only used for their schoolwork. Students at traditional schools will be free from these distractions and poor learning environments which may improve their grades. Online schools could end up costing families and schools systems more. If families have to make sure their student has a working laptop computer everyday then they will spend more money on care and maintenance. Some families might not be able to spend extra money on a new device. Kids could be stuck with old devices that malfunction and do not have updated software. Old computers may not be able to keep up with all the programs students are expected to use. School systems will also have to hire staff so they can operate online schools. New teachers and technological aides would cause taxes to be increased. Families may not be able to keep up with this change. Online schools may seem like a budget friendly option because of lower transportation costs, but for some families it might be catastrophic. Online school could benefit some groups of students like those with long term illnesses and some certain types of learning styles. Students that can not come to a traditional school because of illness but still have enough time and energy to continue learning should look into online schools. That way student who may have to miss months at a time can still keep up with their classmates. Another good use of online school would be for students with different learning styles. Some kids can not sit through long block scheduled classes and would thrive if they could split up the work in a different way. These students could have more freedom with the way they wanted to work and might be more interested in learning. Online school could contribute to certain groups of students continuing to grow intellectually and good learning habits, but overall would not work for the majority of students. Online school currently has many problems, but if those problems can be fixed, online schools would be a great resource depending on what the future holds. Online schools may be more popular in the future, but for the present traditional schools are more effective for the growth of students. In conclusion online schools are better for some students, but right now most students should stay at a traditional school because of more social interactions, fewer distractions, and fewer costs for schools and families.   \n",

Here's my essay on the potential pros and cons of three year high school graduation programs for high school students. So, the thing is, some people think that high school should only last three years instead of the usual four. And I can see why. I mean, think about it, four years is a long time, right? And some kids might get bored or lose interest in school after a while. But then again, there are some pretty big cons to consider too. One pro is that three year high school graduation programs would give students more time to focus on their passions and interests. Like, imagine being able to take more advanced classes in a specific subject, or even start a business or club. It would be pretty cool to have more time to explore your interests and make them a bigger part of your high school experience. Another pro is that it could help students who are struggling in school. If high school only lasted three years, students might have more time to catch up on their work or get extra help from teachers. And it could also help students who are ahead of the game, because they could take more advanced classes and get a head start on college or their future careers. But there are also some pretty big cons to consider. One of them is that it could be really hard to fit in all the necessary classes and credits in just three years. Like, you'd have to take a lot of classes at once, and it might be hard to balance schoolwork with extracurriculars and other stuff. And if you don't get the right schedule, you might end up missing out on important classes or activities. Another con is that it could be really tough on students who are not as academically inclined. If high school only lasts three years, they might not have as much time to catch up or get the help they need. And it could also be hard on students who are really into their extracurriculars, because they might not have as much time to participate in sports, clubs, or other activities. So, overall, I think three year high school graduation programs could be a pretty interesting idea, but there are definitely some pros and cons to consider. It   \n",

       "32044  many school systems now offer distance learning an option for students to learn at home through online methods students are able to video conference with teachers watch prerecorded lectures and receive and submit assignments on sites like google classroom and blackboard the question that should be asked is if students actually benefit from online classes some students with long term illnesses and specific learning styles would learn better but overall most students should choose to avoid online school because of fewer social interactions with peers more learning distractions at home and additional costs for students families and schools students will have less social interaction which may put them behind when it comes to going to college and entering the workforce if students who chose to attend an online school throughout high school decide to go to a traditional college they may be at a disadvantage depending on what they major in it could be very similar to their experience with online school other students would be faced with new challenges like labs and group projects if a students have never done group work before they may struggle with communication and teamwork aspect that it takes to complete difficult group projects it is possible that these students may struggle during their first year or two at college purely because they have trouble interacting with their peers online students may also struggle when entering the workforce they may lack certain social skills necessary to shine during interviews it is wise to send student to traditional school so they can absorb some of the culture that is needed to get far in life students need to be able to get close to their peers through shared experiences at traditional schools in order to really excel in life students learn better in school environments because they are faced with less distractions students who switch to online school may see a drop in grades because they are faced with new distractions like family members pets and poor learning spaces if a student stays at home all day they may have to interact with stay at home parents and family pets who could be very distracting students who feel that they can not tell a pesky parent to stop bothering them will end up juggling their schoolwork family life and walking the dog in traditional schools students learn in classrooms everyday when students attend online school they could do their work anywhere locations such as bedrooms living rooms and next to the television are not good environments for learning students should find a spot which is only used for their schoolwork students at traditional schools will be free from these distractions and poor learning environments which may improve their grades online schools could end up costing families and schools systems more if families have to make sure their student have a working laptop computer everyday then they will spend more money on care and maintenance some families might not be able to spend extra money on a new device kids could be stuck with old devices that malfunction and do not have updated software old computers may not be able to keep up with all the programs students are expected to use school systems will also have to hire staff so they can operate online schools new teachers and technological aides would cause taxes to be increased families may not be able to keep up with this change online schools may seem like a budget friendly option because of lower transportation costs but for some families it might be catastrophic online school could benefit some groups of students like those with long term illnesses and some certain types of learning styles students that can not come to a traditional school because of illness but still have enough time and energy to continue learning should look into online schools that way student who may have to miss months at a time can still keep up with their classmates another good use of online school would be for students with different learning styles some kids can not sit through long block scheduled classes and would thrive if they could split up the work in a different way these students could have more freedom with the way they wanted to work and might be more interested in learning online school could contribute to certain groups of students continuing to grow intellectually and good learning habits but overall would not work for the majority of students online school currently have many problems but if those problems can be fixed online schools would be a great resource depending on what the future holds online schools may be more popular in the future but for the present traditional schools are more effective for the growth of students in conclusion online schools are better for some students but right now most students should stay at a traditional school because of more social interactions fewer distractions and fewer costs for schools and families   \n",
