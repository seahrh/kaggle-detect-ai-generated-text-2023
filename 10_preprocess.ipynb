To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America.

       "0  Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.   \n",
       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.\\n\\nA small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a \"carfree\" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.\\n\\nAnother insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.\\n\\nCould you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits.\\n\\nTo conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.   \n",

       "0  Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do. In like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city. Likewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around. In conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.   \n",
       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed. A small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a \"carfree\" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States. Another insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates. Could you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits. To conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.   \n",

Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.\\n\\n3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.\\n\\n4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”\\n\\n5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\\n\\n6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\\n\\n7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”\\n\\n8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.\\n\\n9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. \\n\\nExcerpt from “In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars” by Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the New York Times.

The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.\\n\\n12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.\\n\\n13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2\\n\\n14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\\n\\n15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.\\n\\n16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.\\n\\n17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.\\n\\n18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.\\n\\n19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1\\n\\nExcerpt from “Paris bans driving due to smog” by Robert Duffer, from the Chicago Tribune.

The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.\\n\\n22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.\\n\\n23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .\\n\\n24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.\\n\\n25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.\\n\\n26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .\\n\\n27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.\\n\\n28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\\n\\nExcerpt from “Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota” by Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times.

It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .\\n\\n32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.\\n\\n33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”\\n\\n34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product r...</td>\n",

Mr. Goldberg added: \"How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.\" 8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities. 9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. 12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. 13 That's easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2 14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . .

The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. 22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota. 23 \"The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,\" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . . 24 \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. 25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. 26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. \"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,\" said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay. . . . 27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. 28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized \"Mustang Sally\" . . . . 32 But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling. 33 \"What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,\" said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. \"I think that means something more fundamental is going on.\" 34 If the pattern persists - and many sociologists believe it will - it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves \"mobility\" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle. 35 \"Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-t...</td>\n",

The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\\n\\n2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\\n\\n3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .\\n\\n4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.\\n\\n5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .\\n\\n6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.\\n\\n7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .\\n\\n8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.\\n\\n# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\\n\\n9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college\\n\\n10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\\n\\n11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?\\n\\n12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.\\n\\n13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .\\n\\n14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\\n\\n# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner\\n\\n15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.\\n\\n16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.\\n\\n17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.\\n\\n## 1) Certainty of Outcome\\n\\n18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .\\n\\n## 2) Everyone’s President\\n\\n19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.\\n\\n## 3) Swing States\\n\\n20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay clo...</td>\n",

Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . . 14 It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! # In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner 15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. 16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed). . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888. 17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons. ## 1) Certainty of Outcome 18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - --it happened in 2000-- - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012's election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes - --538 - --is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . . ## 2) Everyone's President 19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president. ## 3) Swing States 20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates - as we saw in 2012's election - to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign - to really listen to the com...</td>\n",
       "      <td>what is the electoral college by the office of the federal register 1 the electoral college is a process not a place the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens 2 the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress 3 the electoral college consists of 538 electors a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president your state s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation one for each member in the house of representatives plus two for your senators 4 under the 23rd amendment of the constitution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college for this reason in the following discussion the word state also refers to the district of columbia 5 each candidate running for president in your state have his or her own group of electors the electors are generally chosen by the candidate s political party but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are 6 the presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november you help choose your state s electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate s electors 7 most states have a winner take all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate however maine and nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation 8 after the presidential election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors the certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year your state s certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong by bradford plumer 9 what have richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the u s chamber of commerce and the afl cio all in their time agreed on answer abolishing the electoral college they are not alone according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after al gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency 1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now this year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency and yet the electoral college still have its defenders what gives what is wrong with the electoral college 10 under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry on the offchance that those electors won the statewide election they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes who are the electors they can be anyone not holding public office who picks the electors in the first place it depends on the state sometimes state conventions sometimes the state party s central committee sometimes the presidential candidates themselves can voters control whom their electors vote for not always do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate sometimes 11 the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will of the people back in 1960 segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john f kennedy so that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy in the same vein faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please oh and what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress it happened in hawaii in 1960 luckily vice president richard nixon who was presiding over the senate validated only his opponent s electors but he made sure to do so without establishing a precedent what if it happened again 12 perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote in that case the election would be thrown to the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president the senate would choose the vice president because each state casts only one vote the single representative from wyoming representing 500 000 voters would have as much say as the 55 representatives from california who represent 35 million voters given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress the house s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people and if an electoral tie seems unlikely consider this in 1968 a shift of just 41 971 votes would have deadlocked the election in 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5 559 voters in ohio and 3 687 voters in hawaii have voted the other way the election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe 13 at the most basic level

       "0  # In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal\\n\\n1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.\\n\\n2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.\\n\\n3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.\\n\\n4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”\\n\\n5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\\n\\n6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\\n\\n7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”\\n\\n8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.\\n\\n9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. \\n\\nExcerpt from “In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars” by Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the New York Times.

The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.\\n\\n12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.\\n\\n13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2\\n\\n14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\\n\\n15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.\\n\\n16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.\\n\\n17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.\\n\\n18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.\\n\\n19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1\\n\\nExcerpt from “Paris bans driving due to smog” by Robert Duffer, from the Chicago Tribune.

The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.\\n\\n22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.\\n\\n23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .\\n\\n24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.\\n\\n25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.\\n\\n26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .\\n\\n27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.\\n\\n28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\\n\\nExcerpt from “Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota” by Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times.

It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .\\n\\n32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.\\n\\n33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”\\n\\n34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product r...   \n",
       "1  # What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register\\n\\n1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\\n\\n2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\\n\\n3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .\\n\\n4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.\\n\\n5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .\\n\\n6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.\\n\\n7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .\\n\\n8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.\\n\\n# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\\n\\n9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college\\n\\n10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\\n\\n11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?\\n\\n12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.\\n\\n13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .\\n\\n14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\\n\\n# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner\\n\\n15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.\\n\\n16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.\\n\\n17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.\\n\\n## 1) Certainty of Outcome\\n\\n18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .\\n\\n## 2) Everyone’s President\\n\\n19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.\\n\\n## 3) Swing States\\n\\n20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay clo...   \n",

       "0  # In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal 1 VAUBAN, Germany - Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars. 2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban's streets are completely \"car-free\" - except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park - large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. 3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. 4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called \"smart planning.\" 5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. 6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. 7 \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,\" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: \"How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.\" 8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities. 9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. 12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. 13 That's easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2 14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. 15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. 16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. 17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found. 18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC. 19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1 Excerpt from \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by Robert Duffer, from the Chicago Tribune.

The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. 22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota. 23 \"The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,\" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . . 24 \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. 25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. 26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. \"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,\" said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay. . . . 27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. 28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized \"Mustang Sally\" . . . . 32 But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling. 33 \"What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,\" said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. \"I think that means something more fundamental is going on.\" 34 If the pattern persists - and many sociologists believe it will - it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves \"mobility\" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle. 35 \"Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-t...   \n",
       "1  # What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register 1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. 3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . . 4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word \"state\" also refers to the District of Columbia. 5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . . 6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. 7 Most states have a \"winner-take-all\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of \"proportional representation.\" . . . 8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a \"Certificate of Ascertainment\" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. # The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer 9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college - won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What's wrong with the electoral college 10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes. 11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, \"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so \"without establishing a precedent.\" What if it happened again? 12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. 13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . . 14 It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! # In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner 15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. 16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed). . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888. 17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons. ## 1) Certainty of Outcome 18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - --it happened in 2000-- - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012's election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes - --538 - --is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . . ## 2) Everyone's President 19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president. ## 3) Swing States 20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates - as we saw in 2012's election - to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign - to really listen to the com...   \n",

       "0  in german suburb life goes on without cars by elisabeth rosenthal 1 vauban germany residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before they have given up their cars 2 street parking driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of freiburg near the french and swiss borders vauban s streets are completely car free except the main thoroughfare where the tram to downtown freiburg runs and a few streets on one edge of the community car ownership is allowed but there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development where a car owner buys a space for 40 000 along with a home 3 as a result 70 percent of vauban s families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here when i have a car i was always tense i am much happier this way said heidrun walter a media trainer and mother of two as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor 4 vauban completed in 2006 is an example of a growing trend in europe the united states and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use as a component of a movement called smart planning 5 automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle class families from chicago to shanghai tend to make their homes and that experts say is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states 6 while there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser and better for walking planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs vauban home to 5 500 residents within a rectangular square mile may be the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life but its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation with less space for parking in this new approach stores are placed a walk away on a main street rather than in malls along some distant highway 7 all of our development since world war ii have been centered on the car and that will have to change said david goldberg an official of transportation for america a fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the united states who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars mr goldberg added how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid 8 levittown and scarsdale new york suburbs with spread out homes and private garages were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal but some new suburbs may well look more vauban like not only in developed countries but also in the developing world where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities 9 in the united states the environmental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities and legislators are starting to act if cautiously many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year mr goldberg said in previous bills 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport excerpt from in german suburb life goes on without cars by elisabeth rosenthal from the new york times copyright 2009

permission of the seattle times company via copyright clearance center the end of car culture by elisabeth rosenthal 29 president obama s ambitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions unveiled last week will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in american behavior recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by 30 that have left researchers pondering a fundamental question have america passed peak driving 31 the united states with its broad expanses and suburban ideals have long been one of the world s prime car cultures it is the birthplace of the model t the home of detroit the place where wilson pickett immortalized mustang sally 32 but america s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling when adjusted for population growth the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter according to an analysis by doug short of advisor perspectives an investment research company as of april 2013 the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995 part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession because cash strapped americans could not afford new cars and the unemployed were not going to work anyway but by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way the next few years will be telling 33 what most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn said michael sivak who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the university of michigan s transportation research institute i think that means something more fundamental is going on 34 if the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation is the second largest source of america s emissions just behind power plants but it could have negative implications for the car industry indeed companies like ford

       "1  what is the electoral college by the office of the federal register 1 the electoral college is a process not a place the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens 2 the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress 3 the electoral college consists of 538 electors a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president your state s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation one for each member in the house of representatives plus two for your senators 4 under the 23rd amendment of the constitution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college for this reason in the following discussion the word state also refers to the district of columbia 5 each candidate running for president in your state have his or her own group of electors the electors are generally chosen by the candidate s political party but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are 6 the presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november you help choose your state s electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate s electors 7 most states have a winner take all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate however maine and nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation 8 after the presidential election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors the certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year your state s certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong by bradford plumer 9 what have richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the u s chamber of commerce and the afl cio all in their time agreed on answer abolishing the electoral college they are not alone according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after al gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency 1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now this year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency and yet the electoral college still have its defenders what gives what is wrong with the electoral college 10 under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry on the offchance that those electors won the statewide election they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes who are the electors they can be anyone not holding public office who picks the electors in the first place it depends on the state sometimes state conventions sometimes the state party s central committee sometimes the presidential candidates themselves can voters control whom their electors vote for not always do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate sometimes 11 the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will of the people back in 1960 segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john f kennedy so that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy in the same vein faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please oh and what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress it happened in hawaii in 1960 luckily vice president richard nixon who was presiding over the senate validated only his opponent s electors but he made sure to do so without establishing a precedent what if it happened again 12 perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote in that case the election would be thrown to the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president the senate would choose the vice president because each state casts only one vote the single representative from wyoming representing 500 000 voters would have as much say as the 55 representatives from california who represent 35 million voters given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress the house s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people and if an electoral tie seems unlikely consider this in 1968 a shift of just 41 971 votes would have deadlocked the election in 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5 559 voters in ohio and 3 687 voters in hawaii have voted the other way the election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe 13 at the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner takeall system in each state candidates do not spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight races in the swing states during the 2000 campaign seventeen states do not see the candidates at all including rhode island and south carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets do not get to see a single campaign ad if anyone have a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in ohio they have yet to make it 14 it is official the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best it is hard to say this but bob dole was right abolish the electoral college in defense of the electoral college five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president by judge richard a posner 15 the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism 1 a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner the advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense it is the electors who elect the president not the people when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors 16 but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party s nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote yet that have happened very rarely it happened in 2000 when gore have more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes but that was the first time since 1888 17 there are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree 2 all are practical reasons not liberal or conservative3 reasons 1 certainty of outcome 18 a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reason is that the winning candidate s share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote in 2012 s election for example obama4 received 61 7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51 3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney 5 because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number but it is highly unlikely 2 everyone is president 19 the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans regional appeal no region south northeast etc have enough electoral votes to elect a president so a solid regional favorite such as romney was in the south have no incentive to campaign heavily in those states for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win this is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that their votes do not count that the new president will have no regard for their interests that he really is not their president 3 swing states 20 the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in 2012 s election to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election they are likely to be the most thoughtful voters on average and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates and the most thoughtful voters shou...   \n",
