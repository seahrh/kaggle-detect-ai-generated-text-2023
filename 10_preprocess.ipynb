       "      <td>Impact of COVID-19 on the Retail Industry Essay\\n\\nCOVID-19 has affected daily life and slows down the world economy. It has rapidly altered people’s life, industries, and global marketplaces. Its influence on the retail, consumers, and the e-commerce industry is powerful. Brands and retailers confront many short-term difficulties, such as safety, health concerns, supply chain problems, financial sheets, consumer requirements, and business income. Physical businesses shuttered as the lockdown drove individuals to remain home, with millions of retail workers unable to work. The retail industry has been hit hard by COVID-19 as it has lost physical customers, however, the retail industry has a chance to thrive online thanks to a well-established website, a unique brand history, and proper customer communication.\\n\\nIn each country, the retail industry is of prime importance. Retail sale of consumer goods is the most popular type of commercial activity in the world. Despite the economic crisis due to the coronavirus, the retail sector is actively developing and progressing. However, the pandemic greatly affected the algorithm of business. Retail is the sale of goods and services available to all customers in shopping malls and salons through Internet services (Bhatti et al., 2020). The most important element of this trade is the implementation of commercial activities. Another feature is the presence of a certain place where the exchange of goods and money, in most cases, it is a store. The enterprise can be large, medium, or small. In any case, the activity will be built according to the only established rules. They concern interaction with buyers and control services, sanitary and hygienic norms, and quality of goods (Bhatti et al., 2020). Moreover, the retail industry is highly labor-intensive, and any interruptions have huge effects on employment. It also depends on low- and part-time, on-call, and gig employees who do not have the usual social safety mechanisms.\\n\\nAs coronavirus expanded worldwide, the physical businesses shut down, and millions of retail staff could not do their jobs from home. Retailers need to develop a plan that ensures the security of their employees while maintaining their usual activities. Retailers must look at how their staff can deal with different scenarios and develop a strategy for crisis communication (Roggeveen &amp; Sethuraman, 2020). Retailers may utilize stores to inform clients of the product variety, enhance brand image and promote online sales. Retail stores should also consider the impact these significant changes would have on the customer.\\n\\nCOVID-19 caused a global revolution in the introduction of e-commerce. This is due to the need for security and convenience of customers on the Internet. As a result of social distancing being implemented to slow the spread of the virus, there has been a decline in physical shopping. It seems that online shopping will increase as people have adapted to buying things that they would otherwise buy in physical stores from home much faster. Consumers now buy from the products’ websites consistently. Online merchants are strengthening their Internet capabilities and selecting various ways to interact with clients.\\n\\nRetailers need to examine their existing goods and discover in response to various consumer preferences and expectations. Any modifications should be appropriately linked to the changing consumer demands and consistent with current services. Retailers should use rules and practices to designations for safe distances, sterilize surfaces and items, and engage with people proactively and compassionately (Chakraborty &amp; Maity, 2020). Retailers need to speed up the processing of information and the production of new items. Retailers need to improve their customer relationships management (CRM) to deliver client support in real-time.\\n\\nThe pandemic and the resulting crisis will affect retailers and manufacturers. There are several recommendations for retail, such as the need to build pricing based on increased turnover and advertising. Moreover, the adaptation of the promotional policy is essential because – consumers love promotions, and it is challenging to move to the EDLP strategy at this time (Chakraborty &amp; Maity, 2020). Therefore, many networks will continue to use the Hi-Lo strategy.\\n\\nAltering consumer behavior also requires changes in terms of promotional planning, emphasizing new, fast-growing categories. Undoubtedly, in this case, a great chance dynamic pricing and the creation of individual and special offers within the loyalty program framework (Donthu &amp; Gustafsson, 2020). The new reality does not mean shrinking the assortment and focusing only on low-priced products. It entails a qualitative change resulting from a new approach of consumers to reality, forcing the chains to comprehensively rethink their pricing and assortment policies.\\n\\nMost economists agree that even when resuming retail trade offline, public spending on consumer goods will be significantly lower. The introduction of e-commerce will continue, as will the permanent closure of physical outlets (Donthu &amp; Gustafsson, 2020). Therefore, the next few months will be especially difficult for leaders of the consumer sector and retail. Moreover, the decisions they make in the coming weeks could determine their business for the next five years. It is essential to have a plan to resume work at recovery and adapt to new realities. Traditional approaches to planning, characterized by long-term goals, seasons, and quarters, are too inflexible and ineffective to make decisions during a pandemic.\\n\\nDesigners can influence the future of the retail design environment by communicating with customers. Customer focus is a key element of a successful business. It is important to provide customers with quick access to products. It is essential to articulate the message that the designer wants to convey to the client. This way, the buyer forms a pleasant impression and expresses a desire to cooperate. In current conditions, proper communication is crucial in an online context. Also, influence on the future of the retail design environment can be implemented through an exciting story. There are now a huge number of interesting and original products on the world market. The designer must create something exclusive to interest the client and not to repeat the existing services. Designers can develop their own unique history of their brand, such as related to charity or helping animals. Originality in service delivery is a key element of success. (Pantano et al., 2020). Convenience is another element of influence on the retail design environment. Designers need to create user-friendly websites for their products or services so that the customer can quickly navigate the purchase algorithm. Retailers often lose a large number of customers due to poor site design.\\n\\nThe main task of designers is to influence the retail trade so that customers return to shopping in stores. Of course, due to COVID, many people have shifted away from shopping inside the store, because online shopping is much more convenient because it is fast. It is important to predict that people might be interested in returning to offline life. For example, a designer can create a concept of the store, which will combine not only shopping but also entertainment in the store. For example, arrange a photo area or offer coffee. Then people will choose to go to the store, because online shopping will be a little different. Also, the overall layout of retail stores has changed a lot. During the pandemic, a place for hand antiseptics and free masks were added to the interior of stores. This will not only help prevent the spread of the disease, but is to bring retail to a new level. Thus, retail in modern conditions requires uniqueness in the way products and interiors.\\n\\nTo conclude, COVID-19 has touched all sectors, organizations, and industries. The pandemic has resulted in the closure of numerous companies in most industries. The coronavirus hit the retail sector, as all sales had to go online. The economy has suffered huge losses due to the closure of physical stores. However, over time, everyone is adjusting to the pandemic and rebuilding the businesses that have endured losses. Designers can also influence the future of the retail design environment by creating a user-friendly website as well as a unique brand history of the products or services offered and ensuring proper communication with customers,\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBhatti, A., Akram, H., &amp; Khan, A.

highly labor intensive and any interruptions have huge effects on employment it also depends on low and part time on call and gig employees who do not have the usual social safety mechanisms as coronavirus expanded worldwide the physical businesses shut down and millions of retail staff could not do their jobs from home retailers need to develop a plan that ensures the security of their employees while maintaining their usual activities retailers must look at how their staff can deal with different scenarios and develop a strategy for crisis communication roggeveen sethuraman 2020 retailers may utilize stores to inform clients of the product variety enhance brand image and promote online sales retail stores should also consider the impact these significant changes would have on the customer covid 19 caused a global revolution in the introduction of e commerce this is due to the need for security and convenience of customers on the internet as a result of social distancing being implemented to slow the spread of the virus there has been a decline in physical shopping it seems that online shopping will increase as people have adapted to buying things that they would otherwise buy in physical stores from home much faster consumers now buy from the products websites consistently online merchants are strengthening their internet capabilities and selecting various ways to interact with clients retailers need to examine their existing goods and discover in response to various consumer preferences and expectations any modifications should be appropriately linked to the changing consumer demands and consistent with current services retailers should use rules and practices to designations for safe distances sterilize surfaces and items and engage with people proactively and compassionately chakraborty maity 2020 retailers need to speed up the processing of information and the production of new items retailers need to improve their customer relationships management crm to deliver client support in real time the pandemic and the resulting crisis will affect retailers and manufacturers there are several recommendations for retail such as the need to build pricing based on increased turnover and advertising moreover the adaptation of the promotional policy is essential because consumers love promotions and it is challenging to move to the edlp strategy at this time chakraborty maity 2020 therefore many networks will continue to use the hi lo strategy altering consumer behavior also requires changes in terms of promotional planning emphasizing new fast growing categories undoubtedly in this case a great chance dynamic pricing and the creation of individual and special offers within the loyalty program framework donthu gustafsson 2020 the new reality does not mean shrinking the assortment and focusing only on low priced products it entails a qualitative change resulting from a new approach of consumers to reality forcing the chains to comprehensively rethink their pricing and assortment policies most economists agree that even when resuming retail trade offline public spending on consumer goods will be significantly lower the introduction of e commerce will continue as will the permanent closure of physical outlets donthu gustafsson 2020 therefore the next few months will be especially difficult for leaders of the consumer sector and retail moreover the decisions they make in the coming weeks could determine their business for the next five years it is essential to have a plan to resume work at recovery and adapt to new realities traditional approaches to planning characterized by long term goals seasons and quarters are too inflexible and ineffective to make decisions during a pandemic designers can influence the future of the retail design environment by communicating with customers customer focus is a key element of a successful business it is important to provide customers with quick access to products it is essential to articulate the message that the designer wants to convey to the client this way the buyer forms a pleasant impression and expresses a desire to cooperate in current conditions proper communication is crucial in an online context also influence on the future of the retail design environment can be implemented through an exciting story there are now a huge number of interesting and original products on the world market the designer must create something exclusive to interest the client and not to repeat the existing services designers can develop their own unique history of their brand such as related to charity or helping animals originality in service delivery is a key element of success pantano et al 2020 convenience is another element of influence on the retail design environment designers need to create user friendly websites for their products or services so that the customer can quickly navigate the purchase algorithm retailers often lose a large number of customers due to poor site design the main task of designers is to influence the retail trade so that customers return to shopping in stores of course due to covid many people have shifted away from shopping inside the store because online shopping is much more convenient because it is fast it is important to predict that people might be interested in returning to offline life for example a designer can create a concept of the store which will combine not only shopping but also entertainment in the store for example arrange a photo area or offer coffee then people will choose to go to the store because online shopping will be a little different also the overall layout of retail stores has changed a lot during the pandemic a place for hand antiseptics and free masks were added to the interior of stores this will not only help prevent the spread of the disease but is to bring retail to a new level thus retail in modern conditions requires uniqueness in the way products and interiors to conclude covid 19 has touched all sectors organizations and industries the pandemic has resulted in the closure of numerous companies in most industries the coronavirus hit the retail sector as all sales had to go online the economy has suffered huge losses due to the closure of physical stores however over time everyone is adjusting to the pandemic and rebuilding the businesses that have endured losses designers can also influence the future of the retail design environment by creating a user friendly website as well as a unique brand history of the products or

       "      <td>Gender and Educational Level: Chi-Square Study Research Paper\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe research question: Does gender influence the educational level of a person?\\n\\nThe research question is relevant to the chi-square test because gender and education level are the two variables that exist on a categorical scale. While gender exists in two categories (male and female), educational level exists in four categories (ordinary level, advanced level, college level, &amp; university level). According to David and Sutton (2004), the chi-square test is applicable in testing the existence of a relationship between two categorical variables. In this case, gender is one categorical variable while education level is another categorical variable. Since the research question seeks to establish if gender influences educational level, it compares observed and expected education level in a given population. Concerning the research question, one can expect that education level does not vary according to gender, but observations may show otherwise. Thus, the establishment of the relationship between gender and the education level requires a chi-square test.\\n\\nHypotheses\\n\\nThe null hypothesis\\n\\nH 0 : There is no significant gendered difference in education level.\\n\\nThe null hypothesis predicts that gender and the education level are two categorical variables, which are independent and unrelated. In essence, the null hypothesis holds that gender has no association with the education level of an individual. In the chi-square test, the null hypothesis holds if the chi-statistic is less than the critical value and the p-value is greater than a given significant level.\\n\\nThe alternative hypothesis\\n\\nH 1 : There is a significant gendered difference in the education level.\\n\\nThe alternative hypothesis assumes that gender influences the education level of an individual. Essentially, the alternative hypothesis holds that gender and the education level are related or dependent variables. For the alternative hypothesis to be true, the chi-square statistic must have a value greater than the critical value and p-value that is less than a certain significant level.\\n\\nTypes of Error\\n\\nIn the interpretation of the hypothesis, type I and II errors are prone to occur. Rejection of a true null hypothesis results in the commission of type I error. The rejection of a true null hypothesis indicates an outcome of false positive. In this study, if the null hypothesis is true, its rejection implies there is a gendered difference in education level, which is a false positive. In contrast, failure to reject a false null hypothesis makes one to commit a type II error, which shows false negative. Type II error prevents researchers from ascertaining the existence of certain relationships. In this case, failure to reject a false null hypothesis prevents one from accepting a true alternative hypothesis. Therefore, hypothesis testing at significant levels such as 0.05 and 0.01 is appropriate in reducing rejection of a true null hypothesis.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nSampling\\n\\nThe study will sample 100 participants from the population in Chicago city. In selecting participants, the study will employ the convenience method of sampling because it is cheap and easy to conduct. Since the study seeks to establish if gendered difference exists in the education level among people who are in the city of Chicago, it will select 50 men and 50 women (N = 100). Moreover, the study will sample individuals between the ages of 30 and 40 years. People who fall under the age bracket will participate in the study irrespective of their racial and ethnic backgrounds.\\n\\nProcedures\\n\\nIn the research question, gender is the independent variable. Gender is an independent variable because it does not depend on the education level. In an experiment, researchers manipulate the independent variable for it to influence the other variables (Jackson, 2012). In this case, the researcher manipulates gender by ensuring that study participants have equal gender for the findings to be statistically valid. Gender is a discrete variable because one can be either a male or a female; there is no intermediate value or category. Moreover, gender is a qualitative variable because it describes certain qualities of people that are not measurable in terms of digits. The scale of measuring gender is a nominal scale, which exists in categorical form (male and female). Operationally, gender is a nominal variable that gives an attribute of a person as either male or female.\\n\\nThe education level is a dependent variable according to the research question. The education level is a dependent variable because it varies from one person to another. Given that it is a qualitative data, the level of education has discrete values, which have no intermediates. In this view, the level of education is a categorical variable with categories such as ordinary level, advanced level, college level, and university level. The scale of measurement applied in the educational level is ordinal because the education level progresses from the lowest level to the highest level. Thus, the ordinal scale is the appropriate scale for the education level as per the research question. Operationally, the level of education comprises of ordinary level, advanced level, college level, and university level.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nThe appropriate statistical test for the analysis of the collected data is the chi-square test. Since the chi-square test is applicable in testing if there is an association between two categorical variables, the study seeks to use it in establishing if gender has any significant relationship with the educational level of people in Chicago city. Thus, the chi-square test will present a contingency table that shows relationships between gender and educational level. Romesburg (2004) states that the contingency table provides a detailed view of the relationships between two categorical variables, which expound the chi-square test. Moreover, the chi-square test will present the chi-square value (Pearson Chi-square) and p-value. Therefore, the chi-square value and the p-value is important in testing the null hypothesis and drawing the conclusion of the study.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe biases of the study emanate from the sampling method that study will employ. Since the study will employ the convenience method of sampling, there is a high probability that the potential participants will have high levels of education due to their confidence to participate. Also, as the study targets participants between the ages of 30 and 40 years, there is a high probability that most will have high levels of education. Regarding the test, chi-square requires that the collected data must exist as nominal or ordinal data in compliance with one of the assumptions. Additionally, another assumption requires variables to have two or more categories, which are independent. In hypothesis testing, one can conclude that there is a significant relationship between gender and education level if the p-value is less than 0.05 (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, if the p-value is greater than 0.05 (p&gt;0.05), it implies that there is no significant association between gender and education level. Given that the chi-square test measures the association between two variables, one cannot derive the existence of causal relationships between gender and education level. However, the results of the study are significant in establishing if the gendered difference in the education level is present in Chicago city.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nDavid, M., &amp; Sutton, C.

While most families would describe their sick relatives using positive characteristics, on the whole, the reality of day-to-day life has a daunting, cumulative effect on caregivers. Being a caregiver to a person that suffers from disease means planning their errands and routines around their treatment plan and accommodating whatever difficulties being in this position might present. This paper discusses some of the common challenges faced by caregivers, ranging from psychological to logistic.\\n\\nIt appears that many families that care for sick individuals report the lack of adequate resources that could lighten the burden that they are bearing. Namely, family members struggle with accessing relevant training programs, which means what they do in their day-to-day lives to help their relatives is often uninformed by medical evidence. It is readily imaginable how the scarcity of information can be not only frustrating but also plain dangerous.\\n\\nOn top of that, administrative inefficiency is often what caregivers have to deal with. Overloaded with work or insufficiently trained to participate in therapeutic communication, healthcare providers oftentimes ignore family members’ insights. This is unfortunate as it is family members who have visibility on what is happening to sick individuals. They should be in the position to report concerning signs, new symptoms, or a decline in a particular physical or mental capacity and have their voices heard. What aggravates the situation is the stigma that still accompanies some illnesses. For this reason, family members might feel ashamed of their status or see their requests for help as a sign of weakness. As a result, they do not access services promptly.\\n\\nHowever, providing care in a family setting is not only logistically complicated. Being a 24/7 caregiver is likely to take a psychological toll on a person who, despite their best intentions, might feel trapped in their current situation. Adverse psychological effects stem from a variety of factors that are common for caregiver-receiver of care dynamics. For instance, family members who provide care may experience a lack of privacy due to the need to have constant interactions with the receiver of care. At the same time, caregivers may start feeling isolated from friends and family who are not involved in their dynamics. Apart from that, unlike trained professionals, they are barely ever off-duty, meaning that they need to be available at all times and stay vigilant. Their sleep-wake cycle can also be impacted by their responsibilities. It is not surprising that as many as 22% of caregivers report that their mental health has gotten worse as a result of their style.\\n\\nTo recapitulate, families are often the main providers of support, and their difficulties with dealing with the individual, their needs, and assessing services should be better acknowledged by the medical community. Challenges fall into various categories: logistic, administrative, and psychological. Logistically, caregiving means dealing with insufficient educational resources and accommodating a sick individual’s needs daily. When it comes to the administrative side of the question, medical facilities are often inefficient in terms of access to services or recognizing the needs of a family. Last but not least is the psychological toll that caregiving takes on individuals due to social isolation, lack of privacy, and sleep deprivation.\\n</td>\n",

Logistically, caregiving means dealing with insufficient educational resources and accommodating a sick individual's needs daily. When it comes to the administrative side of the question, medical facilities are often inefficient in terms of access to services or recognizing the needs of a family. Last but not least is the psychological toll that caregiving takes on individuals due to social isolation, lack of privacy, and sleep deprivation.</td>\n",
       "      <td>caring for a family member essay caring for a family member should they suffer from a physical or mental condition is often challenging for everyone involved while most families would describe their sick relatives using positive characteristics on the whole the reality of day to day life has a daunting cumulative effect on caregivers being a caregiver to a person that suffers from disease means planning their errands and routines around their treatment plan and accommodating whatever difficulties being in this position might present this paper discusses some of the common challenges faced by caregivers ranging from psychological to logistic it appears that many families that care for sick individuals report the lack of adequate resources that could lighten the burden that they are bearing namely family members struggle with accessing relevant training programs which means what they do in their day to day lives to help their relatives is often uninformed by medical evidence it is readily imaginable how the scarcity of information can be not only frustrating but also plain dangerous on top of that administrative inefficiency is often what caregivers have to deal with overloaded with work or insufficiently trained to participate in therapeutic communication healthcare providers oftentimes ignore family members insights this is unfortunate as it is family members who have visibility on what is happening to sick individuals they should be in the position to report concerning signs new symptoms or a decline in a particular physical or mental capacity and have their voices heard what aggravates the situation is the stigma that still accompanies some illnesses for this reason family members might feel ashamed of their status or see their requests for help as a sign of weakness as a result they do not access services promptly however providing care in a family setting is not only logistically complicated being a 24 7 caregiver is likely to take a psychological toll on a person who despite their best intentions might feel trapped in their current situation adverse psychological effects stem from a variety of factors that are common for caregiver receiver of care dynamics for instance family members who provide care may experience a lack of privacy due to the need to have constant interactions with the receiver of care at the same time caregivers may start feeling isolated from friends and family who are not involved in their dynamics apart from that unlike trained professionals they are barely ever off duty meaning that they need to be available at all times and stay vigilant their sleep wake cycle can also be impacted by their responsibilities it is not surprising that as many as 22 of caregivers report that their mental health has gotten worse as a result of their style to recapitulate families are often the main providers of support and their difficulties with dealing with the individual their needs and assessing services should be better acknowledged by the medical community challenges fall into various categories logistic administrative and psychological logistically caregiving means dealing with insufficient educational resources and accommodating a sick individual s needs daily when it comes to the administrative side of the question medical facilities are often inefficient in terms of access to services or recognizing the needs of a family last but not least is the psychological toll that caregiving takes on individuals due to social isolation lack of privacy and sleep deprivation</td>\n",

This method is widely preferred since it is considerably less expensive than gestational surrogacy.\\n\\nIn gestational surrogacy, the surrogate mother lacks genetic connection whatsoever with the child since and her role is to donate only her womb to carry the child. Both the egg and the sperm are produced by the commissioning parents and the embryo is then created in the lab after which after which it is then transferred into the surrogate’s uterus (Ziegler, 2004).\\n\\nAlthough surrogacy has an ancient history dating back to the biblical times, the issue began to raise controversy in the contemporary society in the 80s with major concerns being raised regarding children welfare and women rights (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nSurrogacy has been executed through artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization which has received a lot of opposition from the institution of family, religion and the society at large.\\n\\nIn fact, of all the assisted reproduction procedures that are being utilized in the modern society, surrogacy remains the most contentious method prompting most legal systems in the world to formulate regulations to govern the practice (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nReasons for Prevalence Of Surrogacy in the Modern Society\\n\\nSome couples opt for surrogacy to provide a solution in case one of the partners is incapable of having a child either due to infertility or other factors (Jonsen, 1998).\\n\\nThe female partner may e experiencing medical complications with her uterus, ovaries or other complications that may inhibit her ability to conceive children and use of a surrogate mother provides the couple with a means through which the couple can acquire a child who is related to one of the partners.\\n\\nIn addition, the use of surrogate mothers provides an easier opportunity for the infertile mother to have a child while avoiding the bureaucratic and cumbersome procedures associated with traditional adoption and also provides her with an opportunity to raise a child who is genetically related to her partner (Jonsen, Veatch., &amp; Walters, 1998).\\n\\nSurrogacy also benefits the fertile partner by providing an opportunity for him to conceive and raise a child who is biologically tied to him and this further avoids ugly situations in marriages such as divorce, polygamy, and adulterous unions among others (Jonsen, Veatch., &amp; Walters, 1998).\\n\\nFurther, the use of a medical practitioner in the entire process of surrogacy considerably reduces the above events and other factors that may promote destruction of the institution of the family.\\n\\nProponents of surrogacy have argued that through surrogate motherhood, a child is given a chance to live and this would otherwise have not have been possible in absence of such arrangements and the child also benefits from being reared by parents who wanted the child so much that they were willing to withstand financial, legal and other hardships to have this child.\\n\\nFurther, One preliminary study revealed that about one third of the surrogate mothers may use the process to help them deal with past experiences that have negatively affected them psychologically. Women that may have undergone abortions or voluntarily given up their children for adoption may utilize this arrangement to derive psychologically satisfaction (Jonsen, Veatch., &amp; Walters, 1998).\\n\\nAlthough there exists numerous potential risks associated with surrogacy arrangements, those risks can be understood by the prospective participants to weigh the effectiveness and drawbacks of using this method of assisted reproduction (Josen 1998). Surrogate motherhood has received extensive media attention in the recent past and has raised a lot of emotional reactions and ethical concerns in the modern society.\\n\\nThe issues raised range from inclusion of third party in the process of procreation and in the basic family set up to the psychological consequences of the arrangement to the parties involved especially the child.\\n\\nUnfortunately scholars lack adequate information to assess the impacts of these issues on the parties involved since the activities surrounding surrogacy such as sperm donation and infertility are still treated with utmost secrecy consequently limiting the scope of the study (Jonsen, Veatch., &amp; Walters, 1998).\\n\\nEffects of Surrogacy Arrangement on the Family\\n\\nThere lacks a systematic controlled investigation on the consequences of surrogacy in family relationships but some studies conducted on assisted reproduction show no adverse effects of these methods on parenting (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nParents of genetically related children conceived through In Vitro fertilization have been found to display good relationships with their children and when differences have been found to exist between IVF parents and natural conception parents, the differences have tended to reflect higher levels of anxiety among IVF parents of infants and preschool children (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nThese mothers who had their children conceived through IVF tended to be more protective of their children and they allowed their children less autonomy relative to natural mothers. Further these parents viewed their children as more vulnerable and special and also demonstrated less maternal efficacy than natural conception mothers (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nSurrogacy arrangements are characterized by anxiety and uncertainties generated throughout the period of pregnancy until the commissioning couple receives the child. This results from lack of a guarantee that the surrogate mother will relinquish the child upon birth since in some past cases surrogate mothers have refused to give up the child to the intended parents (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nConsequently the commissioning parents must ensure that there exists a mutually acceptable relationship between them and the surrogate and they may negatively impact on the couple’s relationship. Greater difficulties may be further experienced by the commissioning mother who may be neither the genetic nor the gestational mother and may feel insecure and excluded in their mothering role (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nMoral Aspects of Surrogacy\\n\\nOne of the dangers inherent surrogacy arrangements is that it may amount to commodification of children (Hendrick, 2010).

The issues raised range from inclusion of third party in the process of procreation and in the basic family set up to the psychological consequences of the arrangement to the parties involved especially the child. Unfortunately scholars lack adequate information to assess the impacts of these issues on the parties involved since the activities surrounding surrogacy such as sperm donation and infertility are still treated with utmost secrecy consequently limiting the scope of the study (Jonsen, Veatch., &amp; Walters, 1998). Effects of Surrogacy Arrangement on the Family There lacks a systematic controlled investigation on the consequences of surrogacy in family relationships but some studies conducted on assisted reproduction show no adverse effects of these methods on parenting (Golombok et al, 2004). Parents of genetically related children conceived through In Vitro fertilization have been found to display good relationships with their children and when differences have been found to exist between IVF parents and natural conception parents, the differences have tended to reflect higher levels of anxiety among IVF parents of infants and preschool children (Golombok et al, 2004).

Various arguments have been put forward to explain the psychological effects of surrogacy on children on the knowledge of their true identity. Negative impacts are especially likely to arise in situations where the children share a strenuous relationship with the commissioning parents and the knowledge that they had come to this world as a result of a commercial arrangement may cause further damage to the relationship and may also interfere with the child's development and self esteem (Hendrick, 2010).

Policy 2 would be completely ridiculous with most students relying on their phones for communication to make it home each day. It is important for students to have their cell phones at school, and it would be completely harmless for a student to have their cell phone out during lunch time or free time. Would it really be free time if the students can't even text or call one another? Policy 1 should be chosen for the schools cell phone policy. Sincerely, Concerned Student</td>\n",
       "      <td>dear principle i think as you reconsider the school s cell phone policy this letter could help you decide i think that you should choose policy 1 allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time other people may say cell phones are distracting but as long as you enforce the seconds part of the policy which is as long as the phones are turned off during class time it should not be a distraction the distraction comes when students are using their phones inappropriately whether it be for messing around or using your phone at times when you should not be having your cell phone out at lunch time and free time should be allowed it is not hurting anyone to have them out and it will not be distracting anyone because it is a free time anyways without being able to use cell phones at lunch times and free times students just wander around aimlessly with nothing to do students should be allowed to have cell phones at school students use their cell phones to communicate not only among one another but to their parents as well without cell phones the school s phones would be crowded with students lost trying to find their parents and or family members i remember before i got my cell phone it was hard to communicate with my brothers and my mother because even if i called my home from the school phone if there is no answer how am i going to get a call back we cannot have half the school at the office trying to get a hold of their parents policy 2 would be completely ridiculous with most students relying on their phones for communication to make it home each day it is important for students to have their cell phones at school and it would be completely harmless for a student to have their cell phone out during lunch time or free time would it really be free time if the students cannot even text or call one another policy 1 should be chosen for the schools cell phone policy sincerely concerned student</td>\n",

It has rapidly altered people’s life, industries, and global marketplaces. Its influence on the retail, consumers, and the e-commerce industry is powerful. Brands and retailers confront many short-term difficulties, such as safety, health concerns, supply chain problems, financial sheets, consumer requirements, and business income. Physical businesses shuttered as the lockdown drove individuals to remain home, with millions of retail workers unable to work. The retail industry has been hit hard by COVID-19 as it has lost physical customers, however, the retail industry has a chance to thrive online thanks to a well-established website, a unique brand history, and proper customer communication.\\n\\nIn each country, the retail industry is of prime importance. Retail sale of consumer goods is the most popular type of commercial activity in the world. Despite the economic crisis due to the coronavirus, the retail sector is actively developing and progressing. However, the pandemic greatly affected the algorithm of business. Retail is the sale of goods and services available to all customers in shopping malls and salons through Internet services (Bhatti et al., 2020). The most important element of this trade is the implementation of commercial activities. Another feature is the presence of a certain place where the exchange of goods and money, in most cases, it is a store. The enterprise can be large, medium, or small. In any case, the activity will be built according to the only established rules. They concern interaction with buyers and control services, sanitary and hygienic norms, and quality of goods (Bhatti et al., 2020). Moreover, the retail industry is highly labor-intensive, and any interruptions have huge effects on employment. It also depends on low- and part-time, on-call, and gig employees who do not have the usual social safety mechanisms.\\n\\nAs coronavirus expanded worldwide, the physical businesses shut down, and millions of retail staff could not do their jobs from home. Retailers need to develop a plan that ensures the security of their employees while maintaining their usual activities. Retailers must look at how their staff can deal with different scenarios and develop a strategy for crisis communication (Roggeveen & Sethuraman, 2020). Retailers may utilize stores to inform clients of the product variety, enhance brand image and promote online sales. Retail stores should also consider the impact these significant changes would have on the customer.\\n\\nCOVID-19 caused a global revolution in the introduction of e-commerce. This is due to the need for security and convenience of customers on the Internet. As a result of social distancing being implemented to slow the spread of the virus, there has been a decline in physical shopping. It seems that online shopping will increase as people have adapted to buying things that they would otherwise buy in physical stores from home much faster. Consumers now buy from the products’ websites consistently. Online merchants are strengthening their Internet capabilities and selecting various ways to interact with clients.\\n\\nRetailers need to examine their existing goods and discover in response to various consumer preferences and expectations. Any modifications should be appropriately linked to the changing consumer demands and consistent with current services. Retailers should use rules and practices to designations for safe distances, sterilize surfaces and items, and engage with people proactively and compassionately (Chakraborty & Maity, 2020). Retailers need to speed up the processing of information and the production of new items. Retailers need to improve their customer relationships management (CRM) to deliver client support in real-time.\\n\\nThe pandemic and the resulting crisis will affect retailers and manufacturers. There are several recommendations for retail, such as the need to build pricing based on increased turnover and advertising. Moreover, the adaptation of the promotional policy is essential because – consumers love promotions, and it is challenging to move to the EDLP strategy at this time (Chakraborty & Maity, 2020). Therefore, many networks will continue to use the Hi-Lo strategy.\\n\\nAltering consumer behavior also requires changes in terms of promotional planning, emphasizing new, fast-growing categories. Undoubtedly, in this case, a great chance dynamic pricing and the creation of individual and special offers within the loyalty program framework (Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020). The new reality does not mean shrinking the assortment and focusing only on low-priced products. It entails a qualitative change resulting from a new approach of consumers to reality, forcing the chains to comprehensively rethink their pricing and assortment policies.\\n\\nMost economists agree that even when resuming retail trade offline, public spending on consumer goods will be significantly lower. The introduction of e-commerce will continue, as will the permanent closure of physical outlets (Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020). Therefore, the next few months will be especially difficult for leaders of the consumer sector and retail. Moreover, the decisions they make in the coming weeks could determine their business for the next five years. It is essential to have a plan to resume work at recovery and adapt to new realities. Traditional approaches to planning, characterized by long-term goals, seasons, and quarters, are too inflexible and ineffective to make decisions during a pandemic.\\n\\nDesigners can influence the future of the retail design environment by communicating with customers. Customer focus is a key element of a successful business. It is important to provide customers with quick access to products. It is essential to articulate the message that the designer wants to convey to the client. This way, the buyer forms a pleasant impression and expresses a desire to cooperate. In current conditions, proper communication is crucial in an online context. Also, influence on the future of the retail design environment can be implemented through an exciting story. There are now a huge number of interesting and original products on the world market. The designer must create something exclusive to interest the client and not to repeat the existing services. Designers can develop their own unique history of their brand, such as related to charity or helping animals. Originality in service delivery is a key element of success. (Pantano et al., 2020). Convenience is another element of influence on the retail design environment. Designers need to create user-friendly websites for their products or services so that the customer can quickly navigate the purchase algorithm. Retailers often lose a large number of customers due to poor site design.\\n\\nThe main task of designers is to influence the retail trade so that customers return to shopping in stores. Of course, due to COVID, many people have shifted away from shopping inside the store, because online shopping is much more convenient because it is fast. It is important to predict that people might be interested in returning to offline life. For example, a designer can create a concept of the store, which will combine not only shopping but also entertainment in the store. For example, arrange a photo area or offer coffee. Then people will choose to go to the store, because online shopping will be a little different. Also, the overall layout of retail stores has changed a lot. During the pandemic, a place for hand antiseptics and free masks were added to the interior of stores. This will not only help prevent the spread of the disease, but is to bring retail to a new level. Thus, retail in modern conditions requires uniqueness in the way products and interiors.\\n\\nTo conclude, COVID-19 has touched all sectors, organizations, and industries. The pandemic has resulted in the closure of numerous companies in most industries. The coronavirus hit the retail sector, as all sales had to go online. The economy has suffered huge losses due to the closure of physical stores. However, over time, everyone is adjusting to the pandemic and rebuilding the businesses that have endured losses. Designers can also influence the future of the retail design environment by creating a user-friendly website as well as a unique brand history of the products or services offered and ensuring proper communication with customers,\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBhatti, A., Akram, H., & Khan, A.

While gender exists in two categories (male and female), educational level exists in four categories (ordinary level, advanced level, college level, & university level). According to David and Sutton (2004), the chi-square test is applicable in testing the existence of a relationship between two categorical variables. In this case, gender is one categorical variable while education level is another categorical variable. Since the research question seeks to establish if gender influences educational level, it compares observed and expected education level in a given population. Concerning the research question, one can expect that education level does not vary according to gender, but observations may show otherwise. Thus, the establishment of the relationship between gender and the education level requires a chi-square test.\\n\\nHypotheses\\n\\nThe null hypothesis\\n\\nH 0 : There is no significant gendered difference in education level.\\n\\nThe null hypothesis predicts that gender and the education level are two categorical variables, which are independent and unrelated. In essence, the null hypothesis holds that gender has no association with the education level of an individual. In the chi-square test, the null hypothesis holds if the chi-statistic is less than the critical value and the p-value is greater than a given significant level.\\n\\nThe alternative hypothesis\\n\\nH 1 : There is a significant gendered difference in the education level.\\n\\nThe alternative hypothesis assumes that gender influences the education level of an individual. Essentially, the alternative hypothesis holds that gender and the education level are related or dependent variables. For the alternative hypothesis to be true, the chi-square statistic must have a value greater than the critical value and p-value that is less than a certain significant level.\\n\\nTypes of Error\\n\\nIn the interpretation of the hypothesis, type I and II errors are prone to occur. Rejection of a true null hypothesis results in the commission of type I error. The rejection of a true null hypothesis indicates an outcome of false positive. In this study, if the null hypothesis is true, its rejection implies there is a gendered difference in education level, which is a false positive. In contrast, failure to reject a false null hypothesis makes one to commit a type II error, which shows false negative. Type II error prevents researchers from ascertaining the existence of certain relationships. In this case, failure to reject a false null hypothesis prevents one from accepting a true alternative hypothesis. Therefore, hypothesis testing at significant levels such as 0.05 and 0.01 is appropriate in reducing rejection of a true null hypothesis.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nSampling\\n\\nThe study will sample 100 participants from the population in Chicago city. In selecting participants, the study will employ the convenience method of sampling because it is cheap and easy to conduct. Since the study seeks to establish if gendered difference exists in the education level among people who are in the city of Chicago, it will select 50 men and 50 women (N = 100). Moreover, the study will sample individuals between the ages of 30 and 40 years. People who fall under the age bracket will participate in the study irrespective of their racial and ethnic backgrounds.\\n\\nProcedures\\n\\nIn the research question, gender is the independent variable. Gender is an independent variable because it does not depend on the education level. In an experiment, researchers manipulate the independent variable for it to influence the other variables (Jackson, 2012). In this case, the researcher manipulates gender by ensuring that study participants have equal gender for the findings to be statistically valid. Gender is a discrete variable because one can be either a male or a female; there is no intermediate value or category. Moreover, gender is a qualitative variable because it describes certain qualities of people that are not measurable in terms of digits. The scale of measuring gender is a nominal scale, which exists in categorical form (male and female). Operationally, gender is a nominal variable that gives an attribute of a person as either male or female.\\n\\nThe education level is a dependent variable according to the research question. The education level is a dependent variable because it varies from one person to another. Given that it is a qualitative data, the level of education has discrete values, which have no intermediates. In this view, the level of education is a categorical variable with categories such as ordinary level, advanced level, college level, and university level. The scale of measurement applied in the educational level is ordinal because the education level progresses from the lowest level to the highest level. Thus, the ordinal scale is the appropriate scale for the education level as per the research question. Operationally, the level of education comprises of ordinary level, advanced level, college level, and university level.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nThe appropriate statistical test for the analysis of the collected data is the chi-square test. Since the chi-square test is applicable in testing if there is an association between two categorical variables, the study seeks to use it in establishing if gender has any significant relationship with the educational level of people in Chicago city. Thus, the chi-square test will present a contingency table that shows relationships between gender and educational level. Romesburg (2004) states that the contingency table provides a detailed view of the relationships between two categorical variables, which expound the chi-square test. Moreover, the chi-square test will present the chi-square value (Pearson Chi-square) and p-value. Therefore, the chi-square value and the p-value is important in testing the null hypothesis and drawing the conclusion of the study.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe biases of the study emanate from the sampling method that study will employ. Since the study will employ the convenience method of sampling, there is a high probability that the potential participants will have high levels of education due to their confidence to participate. Also, as the study targets participants between the ages of 30 and 40 years, there is a high probability that most will have high levels of education. Regarding the test, chi-square requires that the collected data must exist as nominal or ordinal data in compliance with one of the assumptions. Additionally, another assumption requires variables to have two or more categories, which are independent. In hypothesis testing, one can conclude that there is a significant relationship between gender and education level if the p-value is less than 0.05 (p<0.05). In contrast, if the p-value is greater than 0.05 (p>0.05), it implies that there is no significant association between gender and education level. Given that the chi-square test measures the association between two variables, one cannot derive the existence of causal relationships between gender and education level. However, the results of the study are significant in establishing if the gendered difference in the education level is present in Chicago city.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nDavid, M., & Sutton, C. (2004).

Essay\\n\\nCaring for a family member, should they suffer from a physical or mental condition, is often challenging for everyone involved. While most families would describe their sick relatives using positive characteristics, on the whole, the reality of day-to-day life has a daunting, cumulative effect on caregivers. Being a caregiver to a person that suffers from disease means planning their errands and routines around their treatment plan and accommodating whatever difficulties being in this position might present. This paper discusses some of the common challenges faced by caregivers, ranging from psychological to logistic.\\n\\nIt appears that many families that care for sick individuals report the lack of adequate resources that could lighten the burden that they are bearing. Namely, family members struggle with accessing relevant training programs, which means what they do in their day-to-day lives to help their relatives is often uninformed by medical evidence. It is readily imaginable how the scarcity of information can be not only frustrating but also plain dangerous.\\n\\nOn top of that, administrative inefficiency is often what caregivers have to deal with. Overloaded with work or insufficiently trained to participate in therapeutic communication, healthcare providers oftentimes ignore family members’ insights. This is unfortunate as it is family members who have visibility on what is happening to sick individuals. They should be in the position to report concerning signs, new symptoms, or a decline in a particular physical or mental capacity and have their voices heard. What aggravates the situation is the stigma that still accompanies some illnesses. For this reason, family members might feel ashamed of their status or see their requests for help as a sign of weakness. As a result, they do not access services promptly.\\n\\nHowever, providing care in a family setting is not only logistically complicated. Being a 24/7 caregiver is likely to take a psychological toll on a person who, despite their best intentions, might feel trapped in their current situation. Adverse psychological effects stem from a variety of factors that are common for caregiver-receiver of care dynamics. For instance, family members who provide care may experience a lack of privacy due to the need to have constant interactions with the receiver of care. At the same time, caregivers may start feeling isolated from friends and family who are not involved in their dynamics. Apart from that, unlike trained professionals, they are barely ever off-duty, meaning that they need to be available at all times and stay vigilant. Their sleep-wake cycle can also be impacted by their responsibilities. It is not surprising that as many as 22% of caregivers report that their mental health has gotten worse as a result of their style.\\n\\nTo recapitulate, families are often the main providers of support, and their difficulties with dealing with the individual, their needs, and assessing services should be better acknowledged by the medical community. Challenges fall into various categories: logistic, administrative, and psychological. Logistically, caregiving means dealing with insufficient educational resources and accommodating a sick individual’s needs daily. When it comes to the administrative side of the question, medical facilities are often inefficient in terms of access to services or recognizing the needs of a family. Last but not least is the psychological toll that caregiving takes on individuals due to social isolation, lack of privacy, and sleep deprivation.\\n   \n",
       "144421  Surrogacy and How It Affects Families Analytical Essay\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n 1. Background Information\\n 2. Reasons for Prevalence Of Surrogacy in the Modern Society\\n 3. Effects of Surrogacy Arrangement on the Family\\n 4. Moral Aspects of Surrogacy\\n 5. Legal Aspects of Surrogacy\\n 6. Reference List\\n\\nBackground Information\\n\\nThe modern breakthrough in the medical field and specifically in the area of assisted reproduction has resulted in the emergence of new types of families in the contemporary society whereby genetic parenthood does not necessarily guarantee social parenthood (Golombok et al., 2004).\\n\\nSurrogacy, one of the forms of assisted reproduction refers to an arrangement where one woman offers to bear a child on behalf of another person.\\n\\nThere are two types of surrogacy arrangements; traditional surrogacy which involves situations where the surrogate mother donates her womb as well as her egg in order to provide a baby and this consequently renders the surrogate mother biologically connected to the child since they share genetic material (Ziegler, 2004). This method is widely preferred since it is considerably less expensive than gestational surrogacy.\\n\\nIn gestational surrogacy, the surrogate mother lacks genetic connection whatsoever with the child since and her role is to donate only her womb to carry the child. Both the egg and the sperm are produced by the commissioning parents and the embryo is then created in the lab after which after which it is then transferred into the surrogate’s uterus (Ziegler, 2004).\\n\\nAlthough surrogacy has an ancient history dating back to the biblical times, the issue began to raise controversy in the contemporary society in the 80s with major concerns being raised regarding children welfare and women rights (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nSurrogacy has been executed through artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization which has received a lot of opposition from the institution of family, religion and the society at large.\\n\\nIn fact, of all the assisted reproduction procedures that are being utilized in the modern society, surrogacy remains the most contentious method prompting most legal systems in the world to formulate regulations to govern the practice (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nReasons for Prevalence Of Surrogacy in the Modern Society\\n\\nSome couples opt for surrogacy to provide a solution in case one of the partners is incapable of having a child either due to infertility or other factors (Jonsen, 1998).\\n\\nThe female partner may e experiencing medical complications with her uterus, ovaries or other complications that may inhibit her ability to conceive children and use of a surrogate mother provides the couple with a means through which the couple can acquire a child who is related to one of the partners.\\n\\nIn addition, the use of surrogate mothers provides an easier opportunity for the infertile mother to have a child while avoiding the bureaucratic and cumbersome procedures associated with traditional adoption and also provides her with an opportunity to raise a child who is genetically related to her partner (Jonsen, Veatch., & Walters, 1998).\\n\\nSurrogacy also benefits the fertile partner by providing an opportunity for him to conceive and raise a child who is biologically tied to him and this further avoids ugly situations in marriages such as divorce, polygamy, and adulterous unions among others (Jonsen, Veatch., & Walters, 1998).\\n\\nFurther, the use of a medical practitioner in the entire process of surrogacy considerably reduces the above events and other factors that may promote destruction of the institution of the family.\\n\\nProponents of surrogacy have argued that through surrogate motherhood, a child is given a chance to live and this would otherwise have not have been possible in absence of such arrangements and the child also benefits from being reared by parents who wanted the child so much that they were willing to withstand financial, legal and other hardships to have this child.\\n\\nFurther, One preliminary study revealed that about one third of the surrogate mothers may use the process to help them deal with past experiences that have negatively affected them psychologically. Women that may have undergone abortions or voluntarily given up their children for adoption may utilize this arrangement to derive psychologically satisfaction (Jonsen, Veatch., & Walters, 1998).\\n\\nAlthough there exists numerous potential risks associated with surrogacy arrangements, those risks can be understood by the prospective participants to weigh the effectiveness and drawbacks of using this method of assisted reproduction (Josen 1998). Surrogate motherhood has received extensive media attention in the recent past and has raised a lot of emotional reactions and ethical concerns in the modern society.\\n\\nThe issues raised range from inclusion of third party in the process of procreation and in the basic family set up to the psychological consequences of the arrangement to the parties involved especially the child.\\n\\nUnfortunately scholars lack adequate information to assess the impacts of these issues on the parties involved since the activities surrounding surrogacy such as sperm donation and infertility are still treated with utmost secrecy consequently limiting the scope of the study (Jonsen, Veatch., & Walters, 1998).\\n\\nEffects of Surrogacy Arrangement on the Family\\n\\nThere lacks a systematic controlled investigation on the consequences of surrogacy in family relationships but some studies conducted on assisted reproduction show no adverse effects of these methods on parenting (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nParents of genetically related children conceived through In Vitro fertilization have been found to display good relationships with their children and when differences have been found to exist between IVF parents and natural conception parents, the differences have tended to reflect higher levels of anxiety among IVF parents of infants and preschool children (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nThese mothers who had their children conceived through IVF tended to be more protective of their children and they allowed their children less autonomy relative to natural mothers. Further these parents viewed their children as more vulnerable and special and also demonstrated less maternal efficacy than natural conception mothers (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nSurrogacy arrangements are characterized by anxiety and uncertainties generated throughout the period of pregnancy until the commissioning couple receives the child. This results from lack of a guarantee that the surrogate mother will relinquish the child upon birth since in some past cases surrogate mothers have refused to give up the child to the intended parents (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nConsequently the commissioning parents must ensure that there exists a mutually acceptable relationship between them and the surrogate and they may negatively impact on the couple’s relationship. Greater difficulties may be further experienced by the commissioning mother who may be neither the genetic nor the gestational mother and may feel insecure and excluded in their mothering role (Golombok et al, 2004).\\n\\nMoral Aspects of Surrogacy\\n\\nOne of the dangers inherent surrogacy arrangements is that it may amount to commodification of children (Hendrick, 2010). The arrangement may serve to promote the perception that children complete a family like any other consumer goods. Some scholars have warned about the emergence of ‘capitalist baby industry’ which may result in commodification of children as well as the personal attributes such as sex, color height etc.\\n\\nHowever, the argument that surrogacy turns babies into a market commodity seems a little far fetched with some scholars acknowledging that the argument is to some extent exaggerated and the child exchange is valid only to the extent that the surrogacy is regarded as objectionable (Hendrick, 2010).\\n\\nVarious arguments have been put forward to explain the psychological effects of surrogacy on children on the knowledge of their true identity.\\n\\nNegative impacts are especially likely to arise in situations where the children share a strenuous relationship with the commissioning parents and the knowledge that they had come to this world as a result of a commercial arrangement may cause further damage to the relationship and may also interfere with the child’s development and self esteem (Hendrick, 2010).\\n\\nHowever, due to lack of adequate and clear empirical evidence on the long term psychological effects of surrogacy, we can only make predictions about its long term impacts on children and the institution of the family.\\n\\nIt is clear that even though surrogacy is problematic, it is just as problematic as any other conventional family and the dangers involved are neither inevitable nor insurmountable. Therefore, the society should focus more on regulation of the practice rather than involving themselves in pessimistic speculations of its outcome (Hendrick, 2010).\\n\\nLegal Aspects of Surrogacy\\n\\nUniversal laws pertaining surrogacy are dynamic (Ziegler, 2004). It is therefore vital for the parties involved in the arrangement opt consult an experienced attorney in drawing and implementation of the contract.\\n\\nIn the United States back in 2004, only two states were considered ‘surrogate friendly’; California and Arkansas, with California having the case law on how to handle such arrangements consequently making it the most favorable state for surrogacy arrangements (Ziegler, 2004).\\n\\nA considerable number of states lacked outlined laws governing surrogacy and most of them treated it like adoption while in other states such as Washington and New York criminalized paid surrogacy.\\n\\nMost surrogacy legislation fails to give a clear cut distinction in terms of provisions for gestational and traditional surrogacy (Sauer, 1998).

letter could help you decide. I think that you should choose policy 1; allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.\\n\\nOther people may say cell phones are distracting, but as long as you enforce the seconds part of the policy which is, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, it shouldn't be a distraction. The distraction comes when students are using their phones inappropriately, whether it be for messing around, or using your phone at times when you shouldn't be.\\n\\nHaving your cell phone out at lunch time and free time should be allowed. It's not hurting anyone to have them out, and it won't be distracting anyone because it's a free time anyways. Without being able to use cell phones at lunch times and free times, students just wander around aimlessly with nothing to do.\\n\\nStudents should be allowed to have cell phones at school. Students use their cell phones to communicate not only among one another, but to their parents as well. Without cell phones the school's phones would be crowded with students lost trying to find their parents and/or family members. I remember before I got my cell phone, it was hard to communicate with my brothers and my mother, because even if I called my home from the school phone, if there is no answer, how am I going to get a call back? We can't have half the school at the office trying to get a hold of their parents. Policy 2 would be completely ridiculous with most students relying on their phones for communication to make it home each day.\\n\\nIt is important for students to have their cell phones at school, and it would be completely harmless for a student to have their cell phone out during lunch time or free time. Would it really be free time if the students can't even text or call one another? Policy 1 should be chosen for the schools cell phone policy.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nConcerned Student   \n",

It has rapidly altered people's life, industries, and global marketplaces. Its influence on the retail, consumers, and the e-commerce industry is powerful. Brands and retailers confront many short-term difficulties, such as safety, health concerns, supply chain problems, financial sheets, consumer requirements, and business income. Physical businesses shuttered as the lockdown drove individuals to remain home, with millions of retail workers unable to work. The retail industry has been hit hard by COVID-19 as it has lost physical customers, however, the retail industry has a chance to thrive online thanks to a well-established website, a unique brand history, and proper customer communication. In each country, the retail industry is of prime importance. Retail sale of consumer goods is the most popular type of commercial activity in the world. Despite the economic crisis due to the coronavirus, the retail sector is actively developing and progressing. However, the pandemic greatly affected the algorithm of business. Retail is the sale of goods and services available to all customers in shopping malls and salons through Internet services (Bhatti et al., 2020). The most important element of this trade is the implementation of commercial activities. Another feature is the presence of a certain place where the exchange of goods and money, in most cases, it is a store. The enterprise can be large, medium, or small. In any case, the activity will be built according to the only established rules. They concern interaction with buyers and control services, sanitary and hygienic norms, and quality of goods (Bhatti et al., 2020). Moreover, the retail industry is highly labor-intensive, and any interruptions have huge effects on employment. It also depends on low- and part-time, on-call, and gig employees who do not have the usual social safety mechanisms. As coronavirus expanded worldwide, the physical businesses shut down, and millions of retail staff could not do their jobs from home. Retailers need to develop a plan that ensures the security of their employees while maintaining their usual activities. Retailers must look at how their staff can deal with different scenarios and develop a strategy for crisis communication (Roggeveen & Sethuraman, 2020). Retailers may utilize stores to inform clients of the product variety, enhance brand image and promote online sales. Retail stores should also consider the impact these significant changes would have on the customer. COVID-19 caused a global revolution in the introduction of e-commerce. This is due to the need for security and convenience of customers on the Internet. As a result of social distancing being implemented to slow the spread of the virus, there has been a decline in physical shopping. It seems that online shopping will increase as people have adapted to buying things that they would otherwise buy in physical stores from home much faster. Consumers now buy from the products' websites consistently. Online merchants are strengthening their Internet capabilities and selecting various ways to interact with clients. Retailers need to examine their existing goods and discover in response to various consumer preferences and expectations. Any modifications should be appropriately linked to the changing consumer demands and consistent with current services. Retailers should use rules and practices to designations for safe distances, sterilize surfaces and items, and engage with people proactively and compassionately (Chakraborty & Maity, 2020). Retailers need to speed up the processing of information and the production of new items. Retailers need to improve their customer relationships management (CRM) to deliver client support in real-time. The pandemic and the resulting crisis will affect retailers and manufacturers. There are several recommendations for retail, such as the need to build pricing based on increased turnover and advertising. Moreover, the adaptation of the promotional policy is essential because - consumers love promotions, and it is challenging to move to the EDLP strategy at this time (Chakraborty & Maity, 2020). Therefore, many networks will continue to use the Hi-Lo strategy. Altering consumer behavior also requires changes in terms of promotional planning, emphasizing new, fast-growing categories. Undoubtedly, in this case, a great chance dynamic pricing and the creation of individual and special offers within the loyalty program framework (Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020). The new reality does not mean shrinking the assortment and focusing only on low-priced products. It entails a qualitative change resulting from a new approach of consumers to reality, forcing the chains to comprehensively rethink their pricing and assortment policies. Most economists agree that even when resuming retail trade offline, public spending on consumer goods will be significantly lower. The introduction of e-commerce will continue, as will the permanent closure of physical outlets (Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020). Therefore, the next few months will be especially difficult for leaders of the consumer sector and retail. Moreover, the decisions they make in the coming weeks could determine their business for the next five years. It is essential to have a plan to resume work at recovery and adapt to new realities. Traditional approaches to planning, characterized by long-term goals, seasons, and quarters, are too inflexible and ineffective to make decisions during a pandemic. Designers can influence the future of the retail design environment by communicating with customers. Customer focus is a key element of a successful business. It is important to provide customers with quick access to products. It is essential to articulate the message that the designer wants to convey to the client. This way, the buyer forms a pleasant impression and expresses a desire to cooperate. In current conditions, proper communication is crucial in an online context. Also, influence on the future of the retail design environment can be implemented through an exciting story. There are now a huge number of interesting and original products on the world market. The designer must create something exclusive to interest the client and not to repeat the existing services. Designers can develop their own unique history of their brand, such as related to charity or helping animals. Originality in service delivery is a key element of success. (Pantano et al., 2020). Convenience is another element of influence on the retail design environment. Designers need to create user-friendly websites for their products or services so that the customer can quickly navigate the purchase algorithm. Retailers often lose a large number of customers due to poor site design. The main task of designers is to influence the retail trade so that customers return to shopping in stores. Of course, due to COVID, many people have shifted away from shopping inside the store, because online shopping is much more convenient because it is fast. It is important to predict that people might be interested in returning to offline life. For example, a designer can create a concept of the store, which will combine not only shopping but also entertainment in the store. For example, arrange a photo area or offer coffee. Then people will choose to go to the store, because online shopping will be a little different. Also, the overall layout of retail stores has changed a lot. During the pandemic, a place for hand antiseptics and free masks were added to the interior of stores. This will not only help prevent the spread of the disease, but is to bring retail to a new level. Thus, retail in modern conditions requires uniqueness in the way products and interiors. To conclude, COVID-19 has touched all sectors, organizations, and industries. The pandemic has resulted in the closure of numerous companies in most industries. The coronavirus hit the retail sector, as all sales had to go online. The economy has suffered huge losses due to the closure of physical stores. However, over time, everyone is adjusting to the pandemic and rebuilding the businesses that have endured losses. Designers can also influence the future of the retail design environment by creating a user-friendly website as well as a unique brand history of the products or services offered and ensuring proper communication with customers, References Bhatti, A., Akram, H., & Khan, A.

The research question is relevant to the chi-square test because gender and education level are the two variables that exist on a categorical scale. While gender exists in two categories (male and female), educational level exists in four categories (ordinary level, advanced level, college level, & university level). According to David and Sutton (2004), the chi-square test is applicable in testing the existence of a relationship between two categorical variables. In this case, gender is one categorical variable while education level is another categorical variable. Since the research question seeks to establish if gender influences educational level, it compares observed and expected education level in a given population. Concerning the research question, one can expect that education level does not vary according to gender, but observations may show otherwise. Thus, the establishment of the relationship between gender and the education level requires a chi-square test. Hypotheses The null hypothesis H 0: There is no significant gendered difference in education level. The null hypothesis predicts that gender and the education level are two categorical variables, which are independent and unrelated. In essence, the null hypothesis holds that gender has no association with the education level of an individual. In the chi-square test, the null hypothesis holds if the chi-statistic is less than the critical value and the p-value is greater than a given significant level. The alternative hypothesis H 1: There is a significant gendered difference in the education level. The alternative hypothesis assumes that gender influences the education level of an individual. Essentially, the alternative hypothesis holds that gender and the education level are related or dependent variables. For the alternative hypothesis to be true, the chi-square statistic must have a value greater than the critical value and p-value that is less than a certain significant level. Types of Error In the interpretation of the hypothesis, type I and II errors are prone to occur. Rejection of a true null hypothesis results in the commission of type I error. The rejection of a true null hypothesis indicates an outcome of false positive. In this study, if the null hypothesis is true, its rejection implies there is a gendered difference in education level, which is a false positive. In contrast, failure to reject a false null hypothesis makes one to commit a type II error, which shows false negative. Type II error prevents researchers from ascertaining the existence of certain relationships. In this case, failure to reject a false null hypothesis prevents one from accepting a true alternative hypothesis. Therefore, hypothesis testing at significant levels such as 0.05 and 0.01 is appropriate in reducing rejection of a true null hypothesis. Methods Sampling The study will sample 100 participants from the population in Chicago city. In selecting participants, the study will employ the convenience method of sampling because it is cheap and easy to conduct. Since the study seeks to establish if gendered difference exists in the education level among people who are in the city of Chicago, it will select 50 men and 50 women (N = 100). Moreover, the study will sample individuals between the ages of 30 and 40 years. People who fall under the age bracket will participate in the study irrespective of their racial and ethnic backgrounds. Procedures In the research question, gender is the independent variable. Gender is an independent variable because it does not depend on the education level. In an experiment, researchers manipulate the independent variable for it to influence the other variables (Jackson, 2012). In this case, the researcher manipulates gender by ensuring that study participants have equal gender for the findings to be statistically valid. Gender is a discrete variable because one can be either a male or a female; there is no intermediate value or category. Moreover, gender is a qualitative variable because it describes certain qualities of people that are not measurable in terms of digits. The scale of measuring gender is a nominal scale, which exists in categorical form (male and female). Operationally, gender is a nominal variable that gives an attribute of a person as either male or female. The education level is a dependent variable according to the research question. The education level is a dependent variable because it varies from one person to another. Given that it is a qualitative data, the level of education has discrete values, which have no intermediates. In this view, the level of education is a categorical variable with categories such as ordinary level, advanced level, college level, and university level. The scale of measurement applied in the educational level is ordinal because the education level progresses from the lowest level to the highest level. Thus, the ordinal scale is the appropriate scale for the education level as per the research question. Operationally, the level of education comprises of ordinary level, advanced level, college level, and university level. Results The appropriate statistical test for the analysis of the collected data is the chi-square test. Since the chi-square test is applicable in testing if there is an association between two categorical variables, the study seeks to use it in establishing if gender has any significant relationship with the educational level of people in Chicago city. Thus, the chi-square test will present a contingency table that shows relationships between gender and educational level. Romesburg (2004) states that the contingency table provides a detailed view of the relationships between two categorical variables, which expound the chi-square test. Moreover, the chi-square test will present the chi-square value (Pearson Chi-square) and p-value. Therefore, the chi-square value and the p-value is important in testing the null hypothesis and drawing the conclusion of the study. Discussion The biases of the study emanate from the sampling method that study will employ. Since the study will employ the convenience method of sampling, there is a high probability that the potential participants will have high levels of education due to their confidence to participate. Also, as the study targets participants between the ages of 30 and 40 years, there is a high probability that most will have high levels of education. Regarding the test, chi-square requires that the collected data must exist as nominal or ordinal data in compliance with one of the assumptions. Additionally, another assumption requires variables to have two or more categories, which are independent. In hypothesis testing, one can conclude that there is a significant relationship between gender and education level if the p-value is less than 0.05 (p<0.05). In contrast, if the p-value is greater than 0.05 (p>0.05), it implies that there is no significant association between gender and education level. Given that the chi-square test measures the association between two variables, one cannot derive the existence of causal relationships between gender and education level. However, the results of the study are significant in establishing if the gendered difference in the education level is present in Chicago city. References David, M., & Sutton, C. (2004).

                                                                                                                                                                                  Caring for a Family Member Essay Caring for a family member, should they suffer from a physical or mental condition, is often challenging for everyone involved. While most families would describe their sick relatives using positive characteristics, on the whole, the reality of day-to-day life has a daunting, cumulative effect on caregivers. Being a caregiver to a person that suffers from disease means planning their errands and routines around their treatment plan and accommodating whatever difficulties being in this position might present. This paper discusses some of the common challenges faced by caregivers, ranging from psychological to logistic. It appears that many families that care for sick individuals report the lack of adequate resources that could lighten the burden that they are bearing. Namely, family members struggle with accessing relevant training programs, which means what they do in their day-to-day lives to help their relatives is often uninformed by medical evidence. It is readily imaginable how the scarcity of information can be not only frustrating but also plain dangerous. On top of that, administrative inefficiency is often what caregivers have to deal with. Overloaded with work or insufficiently trained to participate in therapeutic communication, healthcare providers oftentimes ignore family members' insights. This is unfortunate as it is family members who have visibility on what is happening to sick individuals. They should be in the position to report concerning signs, new symptoms, or a decline in a particular physical or mental capacity and have their voices heard. What aggravates the situation is the stigma that still accompanies some illnesses. For this reason, family members might feel ashamed of their status or see their requests for help as a sign of weakness. As a result, they do not access services promptly. However, providing care in a family setting is not only logistically complicated. Being a 24/7 caregiver is likely to take a psychological toll on a person who, despite their best intentions, might feel trapped in their current situation. Adverse psychological effects stem from a variety of factors that are common for caregiver-receiver of care dynamics. For instance, family members who provide care may experience a lack of privacy due to the need to have constant interactions with the receiver of care. At the same time, caregivers may start feeling isolated from friends and family who are not involved in their dynamics. Apart from that, unlike trained professionals, they are barely ever off-duty, meaning that they need to be available at all times and stay vigilant. Their sleep-wake cycle can also be impacted by their responsibilities. It is not surprising that as many as 22% of caregivers report that their mental health has gotten worse as a result of their style. To recapitulate, families are often the main providers of support, and their difficulties with dealing with the individual, their needs, and assessing services should be better acknowledged by the medical community. Challenges fall into various categories: logistic, administrative, and psychological. Logistically, caregiving means dealing with insufficient educational resources and accommodating a sick individual's needs daily. When it comes to the administrative side of the question, medical facilities are often inefficient in terms of access to services or recognizing the needs of a family. Last but not least is the psychological toll that caregiving takes on individuals due to social isolation, lack of privacy, and sleep deprivation.   \n",

Effects of Surrogacy Arrangement on the Family 4. Moral Aspects of Surrogacy 5. Legal Aspects of Surrogacy 6. Reference List Background Information The modern breakthrough in the medical field and specifically in the area of assisted reproduction has resulted in the emergence of new types of families in the contemporary society whereby genetic parenthood does not necessarily guarantee social parenthood (Golombok et al., 2004). Surrogacy, one of the forms of assisted reproduction refers to an arrangement where one woman offers to bear a child on behalf of another person. There are two types of surrogacy arrangements; traditional surrogacy which involves situations where the surrogate mother donates her womb as well as her egg in order to provide a baby and this consequently renders the surrogate mother biologically connected to the child since they share genetic material (Ziegler, 2004). This method is widely preferred since it is considerably less expensive than gestational surrogacy. In gestational surrogacy, the surrogate mother lacks genetic connection whatsoever with the child since and her role is to donate only her womb to carry the child. Both the egg and the sperm are produced by the commissioning parents and the embryo is then created in the lab after which after which it is then transferred into the surrogate's uterus (Ziegler, 2004). Although surrogacy has an ancient history dating back to the biblical times, the issue began to raise controversy in the contemporary society in the 80s with major concerns being raised regarding children welfare and women rights (Golombok et al, 2004). Surrogacy has been executed through artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization which has received a lot of opposition from the institution of family, religion and the society at large. In fact, of all the assisted reproduction procedures that are being utilized in the modern society, surrogacy remains the most contentious method prompting most legal systems in the world to formulate regulations to govern the practice (Golombok et al, 2004). Reasons for Prevalence Of Surrogacy in the Modern Society Some couples opt for surrogacy to provide a solution in case one of the partners is incapable of having a child either due to infertility or other factors (Jonsen, 1998). The female partner may e experiencing medical complications with her uterus, ovaries or other complications that may inhibit her ability to conceive children and use of a surrogate mother provides the couple with a means through which the couple can acquire a child who is related to one of the partners. In addition, the use of surrogate mothers provides an easier opportunity for the infertile mother to have a child while avoiding the bureaucratic and cumbersome procedures associated with traditional adoption and also provides her with an opportunity to raise a child who is genetically related to her partner (Jonsen, Veatch., & Walters, 1998). Surrogacy also benefits the fertile partner by providing an opportunity for him to conceive and raise a child who is biologically tied to him and this further avoids ugly situations in marriages such as divorce, polygamy, and adulterous unions among others (Jonsen, Veatch., & Walters, 1998). Further, the use of a medical practitioner in the entire process of surrogacy considerably reduces the above events and other factors that may promote destruction of the institution of the family. Proponents of surrogacy have argued that through surrogate motherhood, a child is given a chance to live and this would otherwise have not have been possible in absence of such arrangements and the child also benefits from being reared by parents who wanted the child so much that they were willing to withstand financial, legal and other hardships to have this child. Further, One preliminary study revealed that about one third of the surrogate mothers may use the process to help them deal with past experiences that have negatively affected them psychologically. Women that may have undergone abortions or voluntarily given up their children for adoption may utilize this arrangement to derive psychologically satisfaction (Jonsen, Veatch., & Walters, 1998). Although there exists numerous potential risks associated with surrogacy arrangements, those risks can be understood by the prospective participants to weigh the effectiveness and drawbacks of using this method of assisted reproduction (Josen 1998). Surrogate motherhood has received extensive media attention in the recent past and has raised a lot of emotional reactions and ethical concerns in the modern society. The issues raised range from inclusion of third party in the process of procreation and in the basic family set up to the psychological consequences of the arrangement to the parties involved especially the child. Unfortunately scholars lack adequate information to assess the impacts of these issues on the parties involved since the activities surrounding surrogacy such as sperm donation and infertility are still treated with utmost secrecy consequently limiting the scope of the study (Jonsen, Veatch., & Walters, 1998). Effects of Surrogacy Arrangement on the Family There lacks a systematic controlled investigation on the consequences of surrogacy in family relationships but some studies conducted on assisted reproduction show no adverse effects of these methods on parenting (Golombok et al, 2004). Parents of genetically related children conceived through In Vitro fertilization have been found to display good relationships with their children and when differences have been found to exist between IVF parents and natural conception parents, the differences have tended to reflect higher levels of anxiety among IVF parents of infants and preschool children (Golombok et al, 2004). These mothers who had their children conceived through IVF tended to be more protective of their children and they allowed their children less autonomy relative to natural mothers. Further these parents viewed their children as more vulnerable and special and also demonstrated less maternal efficacy than natural conception mothers (Golombok et al, 2004). Surrogacy arrangements are characterized by anxiety and uncertainties generated throughout the period of pregnancy until the commissioning couple receives the child. This results from lack of a guarantee that the surrogate mother will relinquish the child upon birth since in some past cases surrogate mothers have refused to give up the child to the intended parents (Golombok et al, 2004). Consequently the commissioning parents must ensure that there exists a mutually acceptable relationship between them and the surrogate and they may negatively impact on the couple's relationship. Greater difficulties may be further experienced by the commissioning mother who may be neither the genetic nor the gestational mother and may feel insecure and excluded in their mothering role (Golombok et al, 2004). Moral Aspects of Surrogacy One of the dangers inherent surrogacy arrangements is that it may amount to commodification of children (Hendrick, 2010). The arrangement may serve to promote the perception that children complete a family like any other consumer goods. Some scholars have warned about the emergence of 'capitalist baby industry' which may result in commodification of children as well as the personal attributes such as sex, color height etc. However, the argument that surrogacy turns babies into a market commodity seems a little far fetched with some scholars acknowledging that the argument is to some extent exaggerated and the child exchange is valid only to the extent that the surrogacy is regarded as objectionable (Hendrick, 2010). Various arguments have been put forward to explain the psychological effects of surrogacy on children on the knowledge of their true identity. Negative impacts are especially likely to arise in situations where the children share a strenuous relationship with the commissioning parents and the knowledge that they had come to this world as a result of a commercial arrangement may cause further damage to the relationship and may also interfere with the child's development and self esteem (Hendrick, 2010). However, due to lack of adequate and clear empirical evidence on the long term psychological effects of surrogacy, we can only make predictions about its long term impacts on children and the institution of the family. It is clear that even though surrogacy is problematic, it is just as problematic as any other conventional family and the dangers involved are neither inevitable nor insurmountable. Therefore, the society should focus more on regulation of the practice rather than involving themselves in pessimistic speculations of its outcome (Hendrick, 2010). Legal Aspects of Surrogacy Universal laws pertaining surrogacy are dynamic (Ziegler, 2004). It is therefore vital for the parties involved in the arrangement opt consult an experienced attorney in drawing and implementation of the contract. In the United States back in 2004, only two states were considered 'surrogate friendly'; California and Arkansas, with California having the case law on how to handle such arrangements consequently making it the most favorable state for surrogacy arrangements (Ziegler, 2004). A considerable number of states lacked outlined laws governing surrogacy and most of them treated it like adoption while in other states such as Washington and New York criminalized paid surrogacy. Most surrogacy legislation fails to give a clear cut distinction in terms of provisions for gestational and traditional surrogacy (Sauer, 1998). As the traditional method continues to be the most preferred method due to its cost efficiency, most states requires stepparent adoption by the intended mother bef...   \n",

policy this letter could help you decide. I think that you should choose policy 1; allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Other people may say cell phones are distracting, but as long as you enforce the seconds part of the policy which is, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, it shouldn't be a distraction. The distraction comes when students are using their phones inappropriately, whether it be for messing around, or using your phone at times when you shouldn't be. Having your cell phone out at lunch time and free time should be allowed. It's not hurting anyone to have them out, and it won't be distracting anyone because it's a free time anyways. Without being able to use cell phones at lunch times and free times, students just wander around aimlessly with nothing to do. Students should be allowed to have cell phones at school. Students use their cell phones to communicate not only among one another, but to their parents as well. Without cell phones the school's phones would be crowded with students lost trying to find their parents and/or family members. I remember before I got my cell phone, it was hard to communicate with my brothers and my mother, because even if I called my home from the school phone, if there is no answer, how am I going to get a call back? We can't have half the school at the office trying to get a hold of their parents. Policy 2 would be completely ridiculous with most students relying on their phones for communication to make it home each day. It is important for students to have their cell phones at school, and it would be completely harmless for a student to have their cell phone out during lunch time or free time. Would it really be free time if the students can't even text or call one another? Policy 1 should be chosen for the schools cell phone policy. Sincerely, Concerned Student   \n",

and educational level chi square study research paper introduction the research question does gender influence the educational level of a person the research question is relevant to the chi square test because gender and education level are the two variables that exist on a categorical scale while gender exists in two categories male and female educational level exists in four categories ordinary level advanced level college level university level according to david and sutton 2004 the chi square test is applicable in testing the existence of a relationship between two categorical variables in this case gender is one categorical variable while education level is another categorical variable since the research question seeks to establish if gender influences educational level it compares observed and expected education level in a given population concerning the research question one can expect that education level does not vary according to gender but observations may show otherwise thus the establishment of the relationship between gender and the education level requires a chi square test hypotheses the null hypothesis h 0 there is no significant gendered difference in education level the null hypothesis predicts that gender and the education level are two categorical variables which are independent and unrelated in essence the null hypothesis holds that gender has no association with the education level of an individual in the chi square test the null hypothesis holds if the chi statistic is less than the critical value and the p value is greater than a given significant level the alternative hypothesis h 1 there is a significant gendered difference in the education level the alternative hypothesis assumes that gender influences the education level of an individual essentially the alternative hypothesis holds that gender and the education level are related or dependent variables for the alternative hypothesis to be true the chi square statistic must have a value greater than the critical value and p value that is less than a certain significant level types of error in the interpretation of the hypothesis type i and ii errors are prone to occur rejection of a true null hypothesis results in the commission of type i error the rejection of a true null hypothesis indicates an outcome of false positive in this study if the null hypothesis is true its rejection implies there is a gendered difference in education level which is a false positive in contrast failure to reject a false null hypothesis makes one to commit a type ii error which shows false negative type ii error prevents researchers from ascertaining the existence of certain relationships in this case failure to reject a false null hypothesis prevents one from accepting a true alternative hypothesis therefore hypothesis testing at significant levels such as 0 05 and 0 01 is appropriate in reducing rejection of a true null hypothesis methods sampling the study will sample 100 participants from the population in chicago city in selecting participants the study will employ the convenience method of sampling because it is cheap and easy to conduct since the study seeks to establish if gendered difference exists in the education level among people who are in the city of chicago it will select 50 men and 50 women n 100 moreover the study will sample individuals between the ages of 30 and 40 years people who fall under the age bracket will participate in the study irrespective of their racial and ethnic backgrounds procedures in the research question gender is the independent variable gender is an independent variable because it does not depend on the education level in an experiment researchers manipulate the independent variable for it to influence the other variables jackson 2012 in this case the researcher manipulates gender by ensuring that study participants have equal gender for the findings to be statistically valid gender is a discrete variable because one can be either a male or a female there is no intermediate value or category moreover gender is a qualitative variable because it describes certain qualities of people that are not measurable in terms of digits the scale of measuring gender is a nominal scale which exists in categorical form male and female operationally gender is a nominal variable that gives an attribute of a person as either male or female the education level is a dependent variable according to the research question the education level is a dependent variable because it varies from one person to another given that it is a qualitative data the level of education has discrete values which have no intermediates in this view the level of education is a categorical variable with categories such as ordinary level advanced level college level and university level the scale of measurement applied in the educational level is ordinal because the education level progresses from the lowest level to the highest level thus the ordinal scale is the appropriate scale for the education level as per the research question operationally the level of education comprises of ordinary level advanced level college level and university level results the appropriate statistical test for the analysis of the collected data is the chi square test since the chi square test is applicable in testing if there is an association between two categorical variables the study seeks to use it in establishing if gender has any significant relationship with the educational level of people in chicago city thus the chi square test will present a contingency table that shows relationships between gender and educational level romesburg 2004 states that the contingency table provides a detailed view of the relationships between two categorical variables which expound the chi square test moreover the chi square test will present the chi square value pearson chi square and p value therefore the chi square value and the p value is important in testing the null hypothesis and drawing the conclusion of the study discussion the biases of the study emanate from the sampling method that study will employ since the study will employ the convenience method of sampling there is a high probability that the potential participants will have high levels of education due to their confidence to participate also as the study targets participants between the ages of 30 and 40 years there is a high probability that most will have high levels of education regarding the test chi square requires that the collected data must exist as nominal or ordinal data in compliance with one of the assumptions additionally another assumption requires variables to have two or more categories which are independent in hypothesis testing one can conclude that there is a significant relationship between gender and education level if the p value is less than 0 05 p 0 05 in contrast if the p value is greater than 0 05 p 0 05 it implies that there is no significant association between gender and education level given that the chi square test measures the association between two variables one cannot derive the existence of causal relationships between gender and education level however the results of the study are significant in establishing if the gendered difference in the education level is present in

                                       caring for a family member essay caring for a family member should they suffer from a physical or mental condition is often challenging for everyone involved while most families would describe their sick relatives using positive characteristics on the whole the reality of day to day life has a daunting cumulative effect on caregivers being a caregiver to a person that suffers from disease means planning their errands and routines around their treatment plan and accommodating whatever difficulties being in this position might present this paper discusses some of the common challenges faced by caregivers ranging from psychological to logistic it appears that many families that care for sick individuals report the lack of adequate resources that could lighten the burden that they are bearing namely family members struggle with accessing relevant training programs which means what they do in their day to day lives to help their relatives is often uninformed by medical evidence it is readily imaginable how the scarcity of information can be not only frustrating but also plain dangerous on top of that administrative inefficiency is often what caregivers have to deal with overloaded with work or insufficiently trained to participate in therapeutic communication healthcare providers oftentimes ignore family members insights this is unfortunate as it is family members who have visibility on what is happening to sick individuals they should be in the position to report concerning signs new symptoms or a decline in a particular physical or mental capacity and have their voices heard what aggravates the situation is the stigma that still accompanies some illnesses for this reason family members might feel ashamed of their status or see their requests for help as a sign of weakness as a result they do not access services promptly however providing care in a family setting is not only logistically complicated being a 24 7 caregiver is likely to take a psychological toll on a person who despite their best intentions might feel trapped in their current situation adverse psychological effects stem from a variety of factors that are common for caregiver receiver of care dynamics for instance family members who provide care may experience a lack of privacy due to the need to have constant interactions with the receiver of care at the same time caregivers may start feeling isolated from friends and family who are not involved in their dynamics apart from that unlike trained professionals they are barely ever off duty meaning that they need to be available at all times and stay vigilant their sleep wake cycle can also be impacted by their responsibilities it is not surprising that as many as 22 of caregivers report that their mental health has gotten worse as a result of their style to recapitulate families are often the main providers of support and their difficulties with dealing with the individual their needs and assessing services should be better acknowledged by the medical community challenges fall into various categories logistic administrative and psychological logistically caregiving means dealing with insufficient educational resources and accommodating a sick individual s needs daily when it comes to the administrative side of the question medical facilities are often inefficient in terms of access to services or recognizing the needs of a family last but not least is the psychological toll that caregiving takes on individuals due to social isolation lack of privacy and sleep deprivation   \n",
       "144421  surrogacy and how it affects families analytical essay table of contents 1 background information 2 reasons for prevalence of surrogacy in the modern society 3 effects of surrogacy arrangement on the family 4 moral aspects of surrogacy 5 legal aspects of surrogacy 6 reference list background information the modern breakthrough in the medical field and specifically in the area of assisted reproduction has resulted in the emergence of new types of families in the contemporary society whereby genetic parenthood does not necessarily guarantee social parenthood golombok et al 2004 surrogacy one of the forms of assisted reproduction refers to an arrangement where one woman offers to bear a child on behalf of another person there are two types of surrogacy arrangements traditional surrogacy which involves situations where the surrogate mother donates her womb as well as her egg in order to provide a baby and this consequently renders the surrogate mother biologically connected to the child since they share genetic material ziegler 2004 this method is widely preferred since it is considerably less expensive than gestational surrogacy in gestational surrogacy the surrogate mother lacks genetic connection whatsoever with the child since and her role is to donate only her womb to carry the child both the egg and the sperm are produced by the commissioning parents and the embryo is then created in the lab after which after which it is then transferred into the surrogate s uterus ziegler 2004 although surrogacy has an ancient history dating back to the biblical times the issue began to raise controversy in the contemporary society in the 80s with major concerns being raised regarding children welfare and women rights golombok et al 2004 surrogacy has been executed through artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization which has received a lot of opposition from the institution of family religion and the society at large in fact of all the assisted reproduction procedures that are being utilized in the modern society surrogacy remains the most contentious method prompting most legal systems in the world to formulate regulations to govern the practice golombok et al 2004 reasons for prevalence of surrogacy in the modern society some couples opt for surrogacy to provide a solution in case one of the partners is incapable of having a child either due to infertility or other factors jonsen 1998 the female partner may e experiencing medical complications with her uterus ovaries or other complications that may inhibit her ability to conceive children and use of a surrogate mother provides the couple with a means through which the couple can acquire a child who is related to one of the partners in addition the use of surrogate mothers provides an easier opportunity for the infertile mother to have a child while avoiding the bureaucratic and cumbersome procedures associated with traditional adoption and also provides her with an opportunity to raise a child who is genetically related to her partner jonsen veatch walters 1998 surrogacy also benefits the fertile partner by providing an opportunity for him to conceive and raise a child who is biologically tied to him and this further avoids ugly situations in marriages such as divorce polygamy and adulterous unions among others jonsen veatch walters 1998 further the use of a medical practitioner in the entire process of surrogacy considerably reduces the above events and other factors that may promote destruction of the institution of the family proponents of surrogacy have argued that through surrogate motherhood a child is given a chance to live and this would otherwise have not have been possible in absence of such arrangements and the child also benefits from being reared by parents who wanted the child so much that they were willing to withstand financial legal and other hardships to have this child further one preliminary study revealed that about one third of the surrogate mothers may use the process to help them deal with past experiences that have negatively affected them psychologically women that may have undergone abortions or voluntarily given up their children for adoption may utilize this arrangement to derive psychologically satisfaction jonsen veatch walters 1998 although there exists numerous potential risks associated with surrogacy arrangements those risks can be understood by the prospective participants to weigh the effectiveness and drawbacks of using this method of assisted reproduction josen 1998 surrogate motherhood has received extensive media attention in the recent past and has raised a lot of emotional reactions and ethical concerns in the modern society the issues raised range from inclusion of third party in the process of procreation and in the basic family set up to the psychological consequences of the arrangement to the parties involved especially the child unfortunately scholars lack adequate information to assess the impacts of these issues on the parties involved since the activities surrounding surrogacy such as sperm donation and infertility are still treated with utmost secrecy consequently limiting the scope of the study jonsen veatch walters 1998 effects of surrogacy arrangement on the family there lacks a systematic controlled investigation on the consequences of surrogacy in family relationships but some studies conducted on assisted reproduction show no adverse effects of these methods on parenting golombok et al 2004 parents of genetically related children conceived through in vitro fertilization have been found to display good relationships with their children and when differences have been found to exist between ivf parents and natural conception parents the differences have tended to reflect higher levels of anxiety among ivf parents of infants and preschool children golombok et al 2004 these mothers who had their children conceived through ivf tended to be more protective of their children and they allowed their children less autonomy relative to natural mothers further these parents viewed their children as more vulnerable and special and also demonstrated less maternal efficacy than natural conception mothers golombok et al 2004 surrogacy arrangements are characterized by anxiety and uncertainties generated throughout the period of pregnancy until the commissioning couple receives the child this results from lack of a guarantee that the surrogate mother will relinquish the child upon birth since in some past cases surrogate mothers have refused to give up the child to the intended parents golombok et al 2004 consequently the commissioning parents must ensure that there exists a mutually acceptable relationship between them and the surrogate and they may negatively impact on the couple s relationship greater difficulties may be further experienced by the commissioning mother who may be neither the genetic nor the gestational mother and may feel insecure and excluded in their mothering role golombok et al 2004 moral aspects of surrogacy one of the dangers inherent surrogacy arrangements is that it may amount to commodification of children hendrick 2010 the arrangement may serve to promote the perception that children complete a family like any other consumer goods some scholars have warned about the emergence of capitalist baby industry which may result in commodification of children as well as the personal attributes such as sex color height etc however the argument that surrogacy turns babies into a market commodity seems a little far fetched with some scholars acknowledging that the argument is to some extent exaggerated and the child exchange is valid only to the extent that the surrogacy is regarded as objectionable hendrick 2010 various arguments have been put forward to explain the psychological effects of surrogacy on children on the knowledge of their true identity negative impacts are especially likely to arise in situations where the children share a strenuous relationship with the commissioning parents and the knowledge that they had come to this world as a result of a commercial arrangement may cause further damage to the relationship and may also interfere with the child s development and self esteem hendrick 2010 however due to lack of adequate and clear empirical evidence on the long term psychological effects of surrogacy we can only make predictions about its long term impacts on children and the institution of the family it is clear that even though surrogacy is problematic it is just as problematic as any other conventional family and the dangers involved are neither inevitable nor insurmountable therefore the society should focus more on regulation of the practice rather than involving themselves in pessimistic speculations of its outcome hendrick 2010 legal aspects of surrogacy universal laws pertaining surrogacy are dynamic ziegler 2004 it is therefore vital for the parties involved in the arrangement opt consult an experienced attorney in drawing and implementation of the contract in the united states back in 2004 only two states were considered surrogate friendly california and arkansas with california having the case law on how to handle such arrangements consequently making it the most favorable state for surrogacy arrangements ziegler 2004 a considerable number of states lacked outlined laws governing surrogacy and most of them treated it like adoption while in other states such as washington and new york criminalized paid surrogacy most surrogacy legislation fails to give a clear cut distinction in terms of provisions for gestational and traditional surrogacy sauer 1998 as the traditional method continues to be the most preferred method due to its cost efficiency most states requires stepparent adoption by the intended mother before a final adoption order is permitted and in some states it is subject to the surrogate s change of heart one of the most important components of an egg donor agreemen...   \n",

the school s cell phone policy this letter could help you decide i think that you should choose policy 1 allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time other people may say cell phones are distracting but as long as you enforce the seconds part of the policy which is as long as the phones are turned off during class time it should not be a distraction the distraction comes when students are using their phones inappropriately whether it be for messing around or using your phone at times when you should not be having your cell phone out at lunch time and free time should be allowed it is not hurting anyone to have them out and it will not be distracting anyone because it is a free time anyways without being able to use cell phones at lunch times and free times students just wander around aimlessly with nothing to do students should be allowed to have cell phones at school students use their cell phones to communicate not only among one another but to their parents as well without cell phones the school s phones would be crowded with students lost trying to find their parents and or family members i remember before i got my cell phone it was hard to communicate with my brothers and my mother because even if i called my home from the school phone if there is no answer how am i going to get a call back we cannot have half the school at the office trying to get a hold of their parents policy 2 would be completely ridiculous with most students relying on their phones for communication to make it home each day it is important for students to have their cell phones at school and it would be completely harmless for a student to have their cell phone out during lunch time or free time would it really be free time if the students cannot even text or call one another policy 1 should be chosen for the schools cell phone policy sincerely concerned student
