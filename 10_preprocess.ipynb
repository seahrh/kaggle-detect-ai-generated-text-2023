       "      <td>Hey, so I gotta write this essay about why it's important to have a strategy before working hard to achieve success. At first, I was like, \"Ugh, do I really gotta?\" But then I was like, \"Wait, this is actually kinda cool!\" So here I am, writing this essay about why strategizing is the bomb.com.\\n\\nFirst off, let's talk about why working hard is important. I mean, it's like, duh, right? You gotta put in the effort if you want to achieve your goals. But here's the thing: working hard without a strategy is like running a marathon without a map. You might be putting in a lot of effort, but you're not gonna get very far if you don't know where you're going. See what I mean?\\n\\nThat's why it's important to have a strategy. It's like a roadmap for your success. It helps you figure out what you want to achieve, how you're gonna achieve it, and how you're gonna measure your progress. Without a strategy, you're just kinda winging it, and that's not always gonna lead to success.\\n\\nBut here's the thing: having a strategy doesn't mean you're gonna succeed automatically. It just means you've got a better chance of success. And that's where considering different opinions comes in. See, when you're making a strategy, you gotta think about what other people might think. You gotta be like, \"Okay, what if this happens? What if that happens?\" And then you can adjust your strategy accordingly. It's like having a backup plan, you know?\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, having a strategy before working hard is super important. It helps you figure out where you're going, how you're gonna get there, and how you're gonna measure your progress. And considering different opinions helps you make a better strategy that's more likely to lead to success. So, yeah, strategizing is pretty cool. Who knew? 😅</td>\n",
       "      <td>Hey, so I gotta write this essay about why it's important to have a strategy before working hard to achieve success. At first, I was like, \"Ugh, do I really gotta?\" But then I was like, \"Wait, this is actually kinda cool!\" So here I am, writing this essay about why strategizing is the bomb.com. First off, let's talk about why working hard is important. I mean, it's like, duh, right? You gotta put in the effort if you want to achieve your goals. But here's the thing: working hard without a strategy is like running a marathon without a map. You might be putting in a lot of effort, but you're not gonna get very far if you don't know where you're going. See what I mean? That's why it's important to have a strategy.

It helps them learn about the community that they live in and to help it run smoothly. Like picking up litter would help the earth by saving it from all the waste that humans just throw out. It'll also help animals from dieing because sometimes the stuff humans just throw out can hurt animals and sometimes kill them.\\n\\nOther kinds of community service is good to. Like giving food to the people that starve and don't have any money to feed there family or give toys to needy children who don't have anything. Doing stuff like that is good to do because it helps other people around them and it also makes the person that does it feel good about themselves.\\n\\nI highly recommend that all students to contribute in community service whether its picking up litter, doing food drives, donations, tutoring or anything that can help out the community. I assure you its not a waste of time.\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME   \n",

One way doing an extracurricular activity could benefit kids is by playing a sport it can teach them many things. Another way doing an extracurricular activity could benefit kids is join a student council is can teach kids how to use their voice. Last way is join any club.\\n\\nA way join a sport could benefit kids is it can show kids what its like to be on a team. That can help them to get a job or if they already have one it can help them during their job. Another way playing a sport can benefit kids it can teach them how to work on a team and how to work well with others.\\n\\nAnother way how extracurricular act ivies could benefit kids is serving on student council it can help kids speak up or fight for what's or to make things equal. That can benefit kids in many ways, such as if while working a job you think something is not be treated right or if someone is not being treated equally you can speak up for what's right.\\n\\nLast way joing an extracurricular activity could benfit kids is by joing a a club. Joing a club could help them interact with more people. Learning how to interact with people can help kids later on life, during a job, in school, or even in public.\\n\\nIn concluison joining an extracurricualr activity could help kids in many more ways then the ones sated above. Playing a sport could benfit kids by teaching them how to work togeter. Serving on a student conciual could help kids use their voice and fight for whats right. Last way is by joing a club it could help kids interact with people. You should join an extracurricular to see what could happen.   \n",

Single-use plastics are a major source of pollution and harm to wildlife. These products, such as straws, plastic bags, and water bottles, are used once and then disposed of, leading to a large amount of waste in our oceans and landfills.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons why single-use plastics should be banned is due to their harmful effects on marine life. Many sea creatures mistake plastic for food or become entangled in it, leading to injury or death. According to the Ocean Conservancy, plastic straws are one of the top ten items found in beach cleanups, and plastic bags are the fifth most common. This shows that these products are not only a problem for marine life but also for our oceans and beaches.\\n\\nAdditionally, the production and disposal of single-use plastics contribute to climate change. The manufacturing of these products requires the use of non-renewable resources such as oil, and the disposal in landfills produces greenhouse gases. This not only harms the environment but also has negative impacts on human health.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the convenience of single-use plastics is necessary, alternatives such as reusable straws and bags are readily available and just as convenient. It is our responsibility to prioritize the health of the environment over our own personal convenience.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the ban of single-use plastics is necessary to protect our environment and wildlife. We cannot continue to ignore the negative impacts of our actions, and banning these products is a small step towards a more sustainable future. It is up to us as individuals and as a society to make the necessary changes to reduce our reliance on single-use plastics and protect our planet.   \n",

At first, I was like, \"Ugh, do I really gotta?\" But then I was like, \"Wait, this is actually kinda cool!\" So here I am, writing this essay about why strategizing is the bomb.com.\\n\\nFirst off, let's talk about why working hard is important. I mean, it's like, duh, right? You gotta put in the effort if you want to achieve your goals. But here's the thing: working hard without a strategy is like running a marathon without a map. You might be putting in a lot of effort, but you're not gonna get very far if you don't know where you're going. See what I mean?\\n\\nThat's why it's important to have a strategy. It's like a roadmap for your success. It helps you figure out what you want to achieve, how you're gonna achieve it, and how you're gonna measure your progress. Without a strategy, you're just kinda winging it, and that's not always gonna lead to success.\\n\\nBut here's the thing: having a strategy doesn't mean you're gonna succeed automatically. It just means you've got a better chance of success. And that's where considering different opinions comes in. See, when you're making a strategy, you gotta think about what other people might think. You gotta be like, \"Okay, what if this happens? What if that happens?\" And then you can adjust your strategy accordingly. It's like having a backup plan, you know?\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, having a strategy before working hard is super important. It helps you figure out where you're going, how you're gonna get there, and how you're gonna measure your progress. And considering different opinions helps you make a better strategy that's more likely to lead to success. So, yeah, strategizing is pretty cool. Who knew? 😅   \n",

Even though human have simaliar muscles to show the same emotion each one does vary a great significance.\\n\\nIn paragraph 6 of the article Dr. Huang made a bold prediction \"A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" This means to him that a students emotions can be completly read by a computer scan. This doesn't seem logical in any means at all. Have you ever watched your classmates facial expression change from confused to them understanding completely in the blink of an eye? Im sure you have. If a computer reads your confused facial emotion in the middle of a lesson right before you understand it, it will change making you have to reset your brain to relearn what you were the the bridge of mastering.\\n\\nIn paragraph 5 a sentence contradicted the article \"Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait,\" if this is true then why would an artifical intelegence be able to read emotions better than a human who experiences the similar emotions? A real life example is when someone is really good at looking like they don't care. This is a hard face to read because some people just naturally have it at all times. With a piece of simple technology how would the scan be able to look past the same face with the same emotion at all times? It most likely couldnt and would be uneffectful in the end.\\n\\nIn paragraph 6 another outside of the box thought was put into words from Dr. Huang \"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that, too,\" The problem with this is that computers don't understand things, they are programmed to do what they are told. Only alive things \"understand\" which means to learn. If we put a program in our computer to read emotions then the computer will most likely only read that exact facial expression.\\n\\nThe use of technology to read emotional facial expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is to far fetched and unpractical. This is because we have teachers, emotions change constantly, emotions are sometimes hard to read, and computers can't \"understand\" how a human is feeling a all times. Maybe one day a computer will be able to read facial expression, but it will be a waste of time and money.   \n",

It helps them learn about the community that they live in and to help it run smoothly. Like picking up litter would help the earth by saving it from all the waste that humans just throw out. It'll also help animals from dieing because sometimes the stuff humans just throw out can hurt animals and sometimes kill them. Other kinds of community service is good to. Like giving food to the people that starve and don't have any money to feed there family or give toys to needy children who don't have anything. Doing stuff like that is good to do because it helps other people around them and it also makes the person that does it feel good about themselves. I highly recommend that all students to contribute in community service whether its picking up litter, doing food drives, donations, tutoring or anything that can help out the community. I assure you its not a waste of time. Thank you, STUDENT_NAME   \n",

One way doing an extracurricular activity could benefit kids is by playing a sport it can teach them many things. Another way doing an extracurricular activity could benefit kids is join a student council is can teach kids how to use their voice. Last way is join any club. A way join a sport could benefit kids is it can show kids what its like to be on a team. That can help them to get a job or if they already have one it can help them during their job. Another way playing a sport can benefit kids it can teach them how to work on a team and how to work well with others. Another way how extracurricular act ivies could benefit kids is serving on student council it can help kids speak up or fight for what's or to make things equal. That can benefit kids in many ways, such as if while working a job you think something is not be treated right or if someone is not being treated equally you can speak up for what's right. Last way joing an extracurricular activity could benfit kids is by joing a a club. Joing a club could help them interact with more people. Learning how to interact with people can help kids later on life, during a job, in school, or even in public. In concluison joining an extracurricualr activity could help kids in many more ways then the ones sated above. Playing a sport could benfit kids by teaching them how to work togeter. Serving on a student conciual could help kids use their voice and fight for whats right. Last way is by joing a club it could help kids interact with people. You should join an extracurricular to see what could happen.   \n",

Single-use plastics are a major source of pollution and harm to wildlife. These products, such as straws, plastic bags, and water bottles, are used once and then disposed of, leading to a large amount of waste in our oceans and landfills. One of the main reasons why single-use plastics should be banned is due to their harmful effects on marine life. Many sea creatures mistake plastic for food or become entangled in it, leading to injury or death. According to the Ocean Conservancy, plastic straws are one of the top ten items found in beach cleanups, and plastic bags are the fifth most common. This shows that these products are not only a problem for marine life but also for our oceans and beaches. Additionally, the production and disposal of single-use plastics contribute to climate change. The manufacturing of these products requires the use of non-renewable resources such as oil, and the disposal in landfills produces greenhouse gases. This not only harms the environment but also has negative impacts on human health. While some argue that the convenience of single-use plastics is necessary, alternatives such as reusable straws and bags are readily available and just as convenient. It is our responsibility to prioritize the health of the environment over our own personal convenience. In conclusion, the ban of single-use plastics is necessary to protect our environment and wildlife. We cannot continue to ignore the negative impacts of our actions, and banning these products is a small step towards a more sustainable future.

At first, I was like, \"Ugh, do I really gotta?\" But then I was like, \"Wait, this is actually kinda cool!\" So here I am, writing this essay about why strategizing is the bomb.com. First off, let's talk about why working hard is important. I mean, it's like, duh, right? You gotta put in the effort if you want to achieve your goals. But here's the thing: working hard without a strategy is like running a marathon without a map. You might be putting in a lot of effort, but you're not gonna get very far if you don't know where you're going. See what I mean? That's why it's important to have a strategy. It's like a roadmap for your success. It helps you figure out what you want to achieve, how you're gonna achieve it, and how you're gonna measure your progress. Without a strategy, you're just kinda winging it, and that's not always gonna lead to success. But here's the thing: having a strategy doesn't mean you're gonna succeed automatically. It just means you've got a better chance of success. And that's where considering different opinions comes in. See, when you're making a strategy, you gotta think about what other people might think. You gotta be like, \"Okay, what if this happens? What if that happens?\" And then you can adjust your strategy accordingly. It's like having a backup plan, you know? So, in conclusion, having a strategy before working hard is super important. It helps you figure out where you're going, how you're gonna get there, and how you're gonna measure your progress. And considering different opinions helps you make a better strategy that's more likely to lead to success. So, yeah, strategizing is pretty cool. Who knew?   \n",
       "5755   In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author is decribing how a new technology: the Facial Action Coding System, is enabling computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology: to read the emotional expressions of students, is not valuable. Even though human have simaliar muscles to show the same emotion each one does vary a great significance. In paragraph 6 of the article Dr. Huang made a bold prediction \"A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" This means to him that a students emotions can be completly read by a computer scan. This doesn't seem logical in any means at all. Have you ever watched your classmates facial expression change from confused to them understanding completely in the blink of an eye? Im sure you have. If a computer reads your confused facial emotion in the middle of a lesson right before you understand it, it will change making you have to reset your brain to relearn what you were the the bridge of mastering. In paragraph 5 a sentence contradicted the article \"Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait,\" if this is true then why would an artifical intelegence be able to read emotions better than a human who experiences the similar emotions? A real life example is when someone is really good at looking like they don't care. This is a hard face to read because some people just naturally have it at all times. With a piece of simple technology how would the scan be able to look past the same face with the same emotion at all times? It most likely couldnt and would be uneffectful in the end. In paragraph 6 another outside of the box thought was put into words from Dr. Huang \"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that, too,\" The problem with this is that computers don't understand things, they are programmed to do what they are told. Only alive things \"understand\" which means to learn. If we put a program in our computer to read emotions then the computer will most likely only read that exact facial expression. The use of technology to read emotional facial expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is to far fetched and unpractical. This is because we have teachers, emotions change constantly, emotions are sometimes hard to read, and computers can't \"understand\" how a human is feeling a all times. Maybe one day a computer will be able to read facial expression, but it will be a waste of time and money.   \n",

       "5755   in the article making mona lisa smile the author is decribing how a new technology the facial action coding system is enabling computers to identify human emotions the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is not valuable even though human have simaliar muscles to show the same emotion each one do vary a great significance in paragraph 6 of the article dr huang made a bold prediction a classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored this means to him that a students emotions can be completly read by a computer scan this do not seem logical in any means at all have you ever watched your classmates facial expression change from confused to them understanding completely in the blink of an eye i m sure you have if a computer reads your confused facial emotion in the middle of a lesson right before you understand it it will change making you have to reset your brain to relearn what you were the the bridge of mastering in paragraph 5 a sentence contradicted the article of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait if this is true then why would an artifical intelegence be able to read emotions better than a human who experiences the similar emotions a real life example is when someone is really good at looking like they do not care this is a hard face to read because some people just naturally have it at all times with a piece of simple technology how would the scan be able to look past the same face with the same emotion at all times it most likely could nt and would be uneffectful in the end in paragraph 6 another outside of the box thought was put into words from dr huang most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication so computers need to understand that too the problem with this is that computers do not understand things they are programmed to do what they are told only alive things understand which means to learn if we put a program in our computer to read emotions then the computer will most likely only read that exact facial expression the use of technology to read emotional facial expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is to far fetched and unpractical this is because we have teachers emotions change constantly emotions are sometimes hard to read and computers can not understand how a human is feeling a all times maybe one day a computer will be able to read facial expression but it will be a waste of time and money   \n",
